An employee at the gas station said surveillance cameras recorded the man checking several car doors before getting into the woman's van. Natalie Martinez reports. (Published Thursday, March 28, 2013) A man snuck into a woman's van while she was inside a Hammond, Ind., gas station paying for her items last week and later abducted and sexually assaulted her, Chicago police said Thursday. The 26-year-old woman was at the Shell station, at 10770 S. Indianapolis Blvd., on March 22 when the attacker hid inside her minivan. He revealed himself as she drove away, police said, and forced her to drive to "various locations." One of those locations was an alley in the 9500 block of South Colfax Avenue, where police said the man dragged the victim into the back of her van and sexually assaulted her. He then forced her to drive to an ATM machine at East 103rd Street and South Torrence Avenue and made her withdraw cash. The man left the woman in her vehicle in the vicinity of West 89th Street and South Lowe Avenue, police said in a community alert. Women at the filling station on Thursday said they were shocked to hear the report. Many said they try to remain aware of their surroundings and take extra precautions. "As soon as I get out of my car I lock my door," said Carol Sanford. "Even if I pump gas I always make sure I only lock, when I press the unlock button, I only unlock my driver door. It doesn't unlock the whole door unless I press it twice." An employee at the gas station said surveillance cameras recorded the man checking several car doors before getting into the woman's van. The woman said her attacker was a black man between the ages of 30 and 33 years. He stood between 5 feet, 8 inches and 5 feet, 10 inches tall and weighed between 160 and 180 pounds, authorities said. He was last seen wearing a black ski mask on his face with a rectangle-shaped opening for his eyes, a long-sleeved, red Chicago Bulls shirt, black and gray jeans, and a dark blue or black varsity-style jacket with horizontal stripes on the sleeves. The jacket had white lettering on the front and a design in white on the back. The attacker implied to his victim that he had a weapon, possibly a knife, but never displayed it, police said.

And it was met with a warm reception, even by longtime fans of the original who refuse to believe that this reboot is neccessary. A second trailer has come online, which is meant for international audiences. It has more than enough new footage to make it a worthwhile watch, and even sheds new light on some of the family dynamic inside the Bowen house. Legendary filmmaker and producer Sam Raimi ("Spider-Man, Evil Dead, The Grudge) and director Gil Kenan (Monster House) are behind this attempt to recapture lightening in a bottle, taking over for producer Steven Spielberg and director Tobe Hooper. Much like their iconic 1982 effort, this new version follows the classic tale of a family whose suburban home is haunted by evil forces. When the terrifying apparitions escalate their attacks and hold the youngest daughter captive, the family must come together to rescue her before she disappears forever. Sam Rockwell and Rosemarie DeWitt are stepping in for Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams, with Kennedi Clements and Kyle Catlett appearing as the Bowen children. This latest footage also introduces Saxon Sharbino as the Bowens' older teenage daughter Kendra, who we didn't really get to see in the stateside trailer release. We also get to see some alternate shots of the Bowen family moving into their new suburban home. This trailer brings an homage to the thunder and lightening storm scene that is so memorable from the first movie. And if you can't get enough of that scary clown, there is more of him too. This version of the trailer also offers more of a look at how social media and personal electronic devices play into the storyline, as they are seen as babysitting devices that work to consume and control the children of today. Oh, yeah, and it looks like we get a takeoff on the memorable tequila worm scene from Poltergeist II: The Other Side!

There was nothing he despised more than trying to walk in or out of a building, and locking horns with other men in a game of oh you first, I insist. But most of all, Theophilus Van Kannel hated opening doors for women. He set about inventing his way out of social phobia. And thats how, in 1888, Theophilus Van Kannel was awarded US Patent #387571 A for a storm-door structure, which would soon become known as the revolving door. Van Kannels invention was an improvement of the pre-existing Tr ohne Luftzug, (literally, Door without draft of air) by the German inventor H. Bockhacker. The first revolving door was installed in a restaurant called Rectors in Times Square in 1899. Thanks to Van Kannel, we have had a perfect solution for keeping dust, and noise, and rain and sleet and snow from entering buildings for over a hundred years. Theres just one problem: people dont use them. Photo courtesy B.A. Cullum, Olivia Lee, Sittha Sukkas and Dan Wesolowski Advertisement Sometimes theyre too heavy to push, or their compartments are claustrophobically narrow. Theres also anxiety about getting limbs caught, or getting stuck in a compartment with another person, and whether or not thats socially acceptable. (And if youve read Alan Moores Watchmen, you might remember that detail about how caped crusader Dollar Bill got his cape caught in a revolving door and was immobilized as a bank robber approached and shot him in the head, point blank.) You kind of have to wonder if the the revolving doors antisocial roots just might be what keeps us from using them. In 2006, a group of MIT students set out to figure out the exact cost of our aversion to revolving doors. They found that revolving doors exchange eight times less air that swinging doors, which can add up to thousands of dollars in wasted energy costs per building per year. You can read the whole study here. The students further observed revolving door usage at a building on campus, and found that only 20 to 30 percent of people were using the revolving doors. They worked on getting some signs put up around campus. Advertisement A few years later, New York City-based designer Andrew Shea thought he would try to replicate the experiment at a building on the campus of Columbia University. Photo courtesy Andrew Shea After about 20 collective hours watching this entryway, Shea found that, similar to the results at MIT, only 28 percent of people were using revolving doors. After putting up some signs of his own design (without campus approval), Shea was able to get usage up to 71 percent. Of course, the best way to get people to use revolving doors is simply to design them better. Newer revolving doors are the visual focus of an entrance; theyre big and spacious, with fewer compartments, and may turn automatically. But if you cant get a new revolving door, Andrew Shea has a revolving door action kit that you can download for free and take to your local office building. Scotch tape not included. Image courtesy Andrew Shea <N> Article by David McCall While the splendidly named H Bockhacker may have been granted the first German patent in 1881 for a Tur ohne Luftzug (door without draft of air), the equally magnificently monikered Theophilus van Kannel is generally regarded as the father of the revolving door, thanks to his patent of 1888. But apparently Kannels design was actually all to do with a certain level of misanthropy or, more so, misogyny. The story goes that he invented the revolving door because he simply hated holding doors open for people, especially women. It has also been reported that Kannel was a man without a family. These two facts may not be unrelated. Nevertheless, Kannels loss (of social interaction at least) was the worlds gain and the first example of his invention was installed in Rectors restaurant in Times Square, New York in 1899. Other positive elements of the system soon became apparent. So too did the pitfalls In his patent, Kannel pointed to the systems numerous advantages over a hinged-door structure it is perfectly noiseless prevents the entrance of wind, snow, rain or dust moreover, the door cannot be blown open by the wind there is no possibility of collision, and yet persons can pass both in and out at the same time. The biggest drawback in the early days of revolving doors, of course, was the safety issue. A 1942 fire at the Cocoanut Grove nightclub in Boston in the US killed hundreds of people, many of whom were overcome by smoke inhalation as they crowded towards the exit, overwhelming the revolving doors and becoming stuck. This is why it is now law in many parts of the world to flank revolving doors with outward swinging hinged doors for use in an emergency. In Australia, however, the history of the revolving door is not so well recorded. It is believed that the first use was at the (then) State Bank in Collins Street in Melbourne in the mid 1980s. Whether the 80-odd years between the take-up of the invention has anything to do with Australians simply being better mannered and friendlier than their transatlantic counterparts is mere conjecture. While they may be happier to converse with strangers in portals, however, it does appear that Australians are lazier than the Americans, as since that first installation it has become far more common to see automated revolving doors in Australia than manual ones. Dormakaba installs somewhere between 30 and 40 revolving doors a year and weve only sold one manual in the last five years, whereas we have colleagues in the US who only do manual revolvers. Its a significant part of the business there. From a cost point of view, there isnt much difference as all youre doing is putting a motor up in the carousel. Fundamentally, though, the benefits of revolving doors are clear and current technology has really only amplified the advantages Kannel indicated in that very first patent. COMFORT The only practical method of ensuring the main entrance to your building provides an effective airlock is to install a revolving door. This is achieved by its rotating carousel design, which provides a consistently closed entry system, effectively a buffer area shielding the comfort of the internal space from the harshness of the external environment. This airlock ensures the external weather conditions do not impact unfavourably on the internal building space, the way sudden cold or hot wind gusts can with a sliding or swing door entry. Other related benefits include a significant reduction in noise from passing traffic, as well as keeping out dust and debris that could normally be blown through an open door. ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND ECONOMY Revolving doors are the best possible automation to control the environment of a building. Kannel referred to their ability to keep out the elements, but as buildings have grown and their occupant numbers have soared, its primarily the external air temperature factor that has become the greatest issue. Revolving doors are used in commercial environments when a high volume of foot traffic enters and exits a building. Air drafts work against insulation technologies and can waste almost all of the energy used by heating and cooling systems, but revolving doors minimise the amount of air that moves in and out of a building. This consistently closed, yet always open, buffer provided by the revolving door provides significant energy efficiency benefits. The centre carousel rotates within its own pocket of air, ensuring the conditioned air of the building foyer does not escape and impact on the energy use of the buildings heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) system. It also ensures that hot or cold air does not flow into the building foyer and this is very important in campus-style office buildings with large void areas from the entrance foyer. To design a five-star Green Star building, the use of revolving doors for the main entrance is considered essential. STYLE Architectural benefits can be just as important as the practical benefits of a revolving door. A revolving door offers a building entrance a striking focal point that cannot be achieved with a linear sliding door system and it can be designed to complement the surrounding facade, tying in multiple design elements such as shape, balance, colour and movement. To establish a unique building entrance, a revolving door is the best possible solution. It can be custom designed in a range of sizes, finishes and features to meet the requirements of the building infrastructure as well as the architectural intent of its designers.

As the entranceway to office buildings its the cause of pavlovian groans (Christ! Here I am again at this hell-hole). As metaphoric short-hand its a stand-in for conflicts-of-interest, matters of ethical oversight, and corruption. Like snapshots from your last colonoscopy, or a multi-million dollar Damien Hirst painting, the images conjured aint pretty. The revolving door has, of course, not always been saddled with such negative connotations. There was a time, not so very long ago, when it was a shining symbol of modern mans ingenuity- evidence of an energized drive toward the future. Yet surprisingly, even in the glow of the revolving doors youth, when it was being enthusiastically installed in buildings the world over, few people were aware of its true origins. Any telling of the revolving doors story must begin with the name Bockhacker, though the length of the tale which follows it varies considerably. German door historians, or Trherstellers as they are reverently called, will, to a man, offer the following information as regards the revolving door-  H. Bockhacker of Berlin was granted German patent 18349 on December 22, 1881 for thr ohne luftzug or door without draft of air. And well, thats about as far as their interest in the subject goes. Outside of Germany the tale is different. All the great door histories (like De Grote Geschiedenis van Deuren and Il Glory dei Portelli) mention Bockhacker, of course, but then shift focus to one Theophilus Van Kannel, of Philadelphia, who in 1888 was granted US patent 387,571 for a storm-door structure. The true story of the revolving door, both known and forgotten, is more than anything the story of Van Kannel. Some commonly known facts about Van Kannel and his revolving door include:  It is perfectly noiseless.  It effectually prevents the entrance of, snow, rain or dust.  It cannot be blown open by the wind.  It excludes street noise.  Persons can pass both in and out at the same time.  It prevents a direct path between the interior and exterior of a structure, making it useful as a partial airlock, minimizing heat-loss.  It circumvents all that annoying You first No, you first stuff.  The worlds first revolving door was installed at Rectors, a restaurant in Manhattans Times Square, located on Broadway between west 43rd and 44th streets, in 1899. Some largely forgotten facts about Van Kannel and his revolving door include:  The original slogan for his door was always closed.  It was marketed (in the Victorian manner) as helping to avoid noxious effluvia and baleful miasmas. Van Kannel himself authored a pamphlet which included the following: It will save life, by preventing those deadly lung and throat diseases which are sure to overtake the unfortunate salesman, cashier, or clerk whose duty keeps him near the constantly opening front door.  Van Kannel was an irritable sort. In response to the initial reaction to his door he had this to say: Just like a turn-stile, so say nine out of ten persons who first see it. As well may we say a tea-kettle is like a locomotive boiler.  Van Kannel originally intended his invention to be installed not only in public buildings but in private homes as well. Which brings us to the crux of things- That Van Kannels invention turned out to be useful, in the ways we consider it to be so today, is something of a happy accident. Thats not to say the inventor didnt have a purpose in mind, he spent years perfecting his idea after all, but if you were to run down the list of its touted benefits youd be forgiven for never coming upon the intended one. More than anything the world owes the invention of the revolving door to revenge. It seems that when Van Kennel was a boy, still in the care of his mother but just on the cusp of cultural manhood, he found the lingering rules of chivalry rather bothersome. In particular he refused to accept that he was expected to open the door for women and allow them to cross the threshold before him. A silly sort of quirk to our minds, certainly, but it was taken seriously enough by his mother that after numerous warnings and threats she eventually felt compelled to take action. Van Kennel family histories have it that at some point in his twelfth year she administered a savage bare-bottomed spanking, during a salon in the familys drawing room, in full and explicit view of 37 local mothers and daughters. This very public shaming over what amounted to a matter of chivalry stuck with Van Kannel (no wonder- Spankophilus being a whisper that seemed to dog his steps for years afterward) and, far from teaching him a lesson, embittered him even further toward the gentlemanly behavior polite society required. Had this been the only episode the world may have never had a revolving door to shuffle through. As it so happens, however, Theophilus Van Kennel married a woman who, though beautiful and slyly clever, had an odd and stubborn quirk of her own. Young Abigail Van Kennel, it seems, refused to pass from one room of their apartments to another without the assistance of Theophilus. As a biographer later explained: She was willing to make many concessions to the new modern ways, but her mother had taught her to take matters of chivalry very seriously indeed. Manners are the measure of a man! shed said More so than his inseam, rest assured! Needless to say Theophilus was unaware of this outlook when he took Abigail as his wife, and was none to pleased at finding it out on their honeymoon. The result amounted to a battle of wills, fought atop a mountain, which to onlookers looked suspiciously like a mole-hill. Theophilus had on one occasion tried to put his foot down on the matter, telling his wife in the morning, all this opening doors twaddle just will not do! I can not be rushing around my own home to usher you from room to room! You are a grown woman and can locomote perfectly well on your own. after which he stormed out of the house. He returned home in the evening only to find Abigail sitting defiantly just inside the bedroom door, right where hed left her. With the ugliness of Fates sense of humor now blindingly apparent, Van Kennel, incensed and stubborn as an ill mannered he-goat, devoted his full focus to finding some way to sidestep this rule of chivalry, or even, perhaps, create cause for a complete revision of the rules. 3 years and $9,837 later he found his answer in what we now call the revolving door. You see, contrary to what you might think, the revolving door was not designed to keep out snow, or to minimize heat loss (though that it does both certainly lead to its success). Theophilus had something different in mind. The revolving door was designed specifically so that whomever enters the door first is obliged to do all the pushing! This was Theophilus breakthrough. He saw immediately that with his design it would actually be most chivalrous for the man to proceed through the door first. He hoped that, without being reduced to stating it baldly, people would recognize this fact, and that when they did, presto! door-holding would be relegated to the stinking, festering, and massive compost heap of history. He did not count on this eventuality of course, having learned by then that traditions could, and traditionally did, prove irrationally tenacious. His design addressed this, however, and he was satisfied by the private knowledge that with his door at least, the act of obliging women first passage would be, in point of fact, the act of obliging them to open the door for you! His own home, as well as the home of his mother, were outfitted with the first 14 revolving doors ever assembled. In the years that followed, after his invention had taken root, though the tiresome rules of chivalry showed no sign of adapting, the loophole hed so cleverly engineered amused him to no end. Hed walk past buildings in which his doors had been installed and laugh. He thought of the women all over New York being ushered dutifully into revolving doors by browbeaten sons and husbands, all proclaiming with a twinkle in their eyes, No, no, after you! And that my friends is the true, very nearly forgotten, secret history of the revolving door. - Disclosure: Most factual bits of this post were gleaned from James Buzards piece Perceptual Revolution while all untruths are, I assure you, my own.

It's "mol" (prounounced "MOH-lay"), and it's a complicated sauce that is usually served over chicken or turkey. 3) "Crab boil" is etymologically similar to "fish fry" (i.e., "let's boil a bunch of crabs"). The Zatarain's product is a mix of spices that are added to the water when boiling crabs.

This (and other things) helped spur on a group of protesters, black and white, to jump into the pool as a strategically planned event to end segregation at motel pools. The pool at this motel was designated white only. Whites who paid for motel rooms invited blacks to join them in the motel pool as their guests. This swim-in was planned by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr and two associates. The motel manager, Jimmy Brock, in an effort to break up the party, poured a bottle of muriatic acid into the pool, hoping the swimmers would become scared and leave. One swimmer, who knew that the ratio of acid to pool water was so great that the acid was no longer a threat, drank some of the pool water to calm the other swimmers fears. Muriatic acid is undiluted hydrochloric acid and is used in the cleaning of masonry surfaces such as pools. But what people heard was the word acid. It did not scare the swimmers, though it seems like it was effective in making the protesters at least nervous  the amount of acid to the amount of water being so small it was mostly safeand so a cop jumped in to arrest people. Many people from that time remember Brock as more the victim in the incident. One moment of temper led to an unwanted legacy. Jimmy kind of caught the brunt of it. He was a nice guy. said Eddy Mussallem, a fellow hotelier and longtime friend. They had to pick a motel, so they picked Jimmys motel. I always told him he did a foolish thing. Brock found himself pressured by civil rights groups and militant whites fighting integration. On 2007, aged 85, Jimmy Brock died at his St. Augustine home. The motel and pool were demolished in March 2003, despite five years of protests, thus eliminating one of the nations important landmarks of the Civil Rights Movement. A Hilton Hotel was built on the site. <N> Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe See our privacy notice Thank you for subscribing!

The risky orgies are usually attended by gay men and offer the so-called 'thrill' of not knowing whether or not you will be infected . Doctors in Barcelona have seen a rise in the number of such parties, which they claim is a sign that people have "lost respect" for HIV. Dr Josep Mallolas of Hospital Clinic Barcelona told el Periodico : "There is everything: sex roulette parties, or sex parties you can only attend if you already have HIV." He added that some of the events are known as 'blue' parties because attendees take anti-viral drugs to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus.

Speaking last year, she told Serbian newspaper Telegraf: "I can see that everyone is talking about sex parties now, but in fact they have been common for a long time even here in Serbia. "In fact what really shocked me was this bizarre variation that seems popular for extreme sex. "People who turn up for the party wear masks, and one of them has HIV. "The wealthy organise these sex parties for other rich people. The real kick for these people is apparently the risk that they might be the one having sex with the HIV-infected partner."

Los especialistas, entre los que figura el doctor Josep Mallolas, adjunto en el citado servicio, advierten de que "se ha perdido el respeto" a una enfermedad que, bien tratada, no resulta mortal ya que se puede sobrellevar de forma crnica, pero que es incurable y potencialmente mortal. Estos encuentros, informa la Cadena Ser, consisten en grupos --habitualmente hombres homosexuales- que se citan en un local con el objetivo de celebrar una orga o mantener relaciones sexuales colectivas, incluyendo al invitado que sufre el sida pero sin revelar a los participantes cul de ellos es el individuo enfermo. "A quien le toca, le toca", explican. GRUPOS DE SANOS O DE INFECTADOS Las ruletas sexuales tienen diversos formatos. Unas son exclusivas para portadores del VIH, y otras a las que pueden acceder tambin personas sanas. "Hay de todo: fiestas que son autnticas ruletas sexuales, o encuentros a los que no puedes acudir si no ests ya infectado por el VIH", ha explicado Mallolas. La enfermedad sigue siendo mortal en los pases donde la poblacin no dispone de sistema sanitario financiado pblicamente, pero es evidente, aadi Mallolas, que aqu no se la teme. El especialista ha relatado a la emisora el comentario que le hizo un homosexual de 22 aos: "Me dijo, mi sexualidad es importantsima y no me quiero resignar, a los 22 aos, a vivir el resto de mi vida con un preservativo puesto. Que alternativa tengo?: Infectarme. Y cuanto antes me infecte y antes me trate y mantenga una carga viral indetectable, antes dejar de sufrir por si me infecto", ha explicado Mallolas. "Cuando me lo dijo, me qued helado", ha aadido el mdico. La terapia antirretroviral que debe seguir un infectado por el VIH cuesta a la Conselleria de Salut unos 7.000 euros al ao, ms los frmacos que el paciente necesita para eliminar otras infecciones ocasionales, frecuentes en estas personas. En Catalunya reciben tratamiento antisida unas 30.000 personas. El colectivo homosexual es el nico que experimenta un constante incremento en las cifras de nuevos infectados, indica Salut. <N> It was an all-red, over-the-banner Drudge headline, guaranteed to grab attention. "MAG: 25% OF NEW HIV-INFECTED GAY MEN SOUGHT OUT VIRUS, SAYS SAN FRAN HEALTH OFFICIAL." Drudge was referring to a four-page story by one Gregory A. Freeman, in Rolling Stone magazine, owned by gay media mogul Jann Wenner. It was quickly picked up by conservative talk-show host Sean Hannity, who never misses an opportunity to denigrate gay men. For many who witnessed the media onslaught, it will soon be accepted as fact. That's a shame, because not long after hitting the newsstands, the story has completely fallen apart. The story centers on a bizarre sub-subcultural phenomenon known as "bug chasing." A few HIV-negative gay men, for all sorts of deep and dark psychological reasons, appear actually to be seeking out HIV infection. Some HIV-positive men, it is also alleged, are just as willing to infect these troubled souls with HIV. This disturbing phenomenon is not new. There were occasional stories about it in the late 1990s, stories that fueled an urban legend but that never made it to the mainstream. Why? Because of simple lack of hard evidence that anyone but a very few disturbed people were involved. How widespread is this phenomenon today? According to the Rolling Stone story, a jaw-dropping 25 percent of new gay male HIV infections are due to bug chasing. That's an astonishing statistic, and it's what made this sub-subcultural practice suddenly an actual news story, worth four pages of Rolling Stone and a headline on Drudge. It's the hinge on which the merit of this story hangs. If true, we should indeed be alarmed. But now for the obvious follow-up: Which study found this alarming result? The answer is: none. The entire premise for the story, as published, is based on one doctor's "estimate." And the more you read the story, the thinner it gets. How many actual bug chasers are interviewed? A grand total of two, one of whom -- the one who provides all the most lurid quotes -- is clearly disturbed and is given a pseudonym. How many HIV-positive "gift givers" are interviewed? None. So there you have it. One anonymous source; one named source; one doctor's completely unsubstantiated estimate; and lurid details from some Web sites. None of the major AIDS and gay specialists interviewed by Freeman agreed that this was a major phenomenon, let alone responsible for 25 percent of all new HIV infections. Freeman's explanation for this universal view that, while troubling, bug chasing is a tiny facet of gay sexuality? All the experts, except his 25 percent-quoting doctor, are in denial, or engaging in a p.c. coverup. Who's the doctor? He's Bob Cabaj, a psychiatrist and director of behavioral health services for San Francisco County. He has conducted no studies on the matter; he has no hard data; and he presides over a publicly funded body dealing with behavioral health, a body that would benefit from increased funding if this new alleged phenomenon is real. The piece doesn't provide this context, and the credulous author seems to take every claim Cabaj makes more seriously than Cabaj himself does. Freeman doesn't even provide any internal substantiation for Cabaj's personal estimate -- no anecdotes of how many such bug chasers Cabaj has seen over the years, whether that number is increasing, and so on. Moreover, Cabaj says several apparently conflicting things in the piece. He first says of his fellow HIV specialists, "I don't know if it's an active cover-up." Then he says, "Yes, it is an active cover-up because they know about it. They're in denial of this issue." Similarly, Cabaj first claims that a quarter of all new gay HIV infections are through bug chasing; then he says "it may be a small number of people ... The clinical impact is profound, no matter how small the numbers." So what is it? A huge phenomenon, amounting to a quarter of all new infections? Or a "small number of people," who nevertheless have a massive impact on HIV transmission? It's unclear what the experts in Freeman's article are even trying to say. There appears to be a good reason for that: As soon as the story faced any scrutiny, it began to unravel. On Wednesday, Cabaj responded to an e-mail from the blog site Morons.org and retracted the 25 percent figure altogether -- and claimed he had asked Rolling Stone's fact-checker to do just that. Then Thursday, Newsweek reported not only that Cabaj denies giving Freeman the 25 percent figure ("That's totally false. I never said that") but that Dr. Marshall Forstein of Boston, quoted in the Rolling Stone story saying that "bug chasers are seen regularly in the Fenway health system, and the phenomenon is growing," says that quote "is entirely a fabrication" and that "I said, 'We have seen a few cases, but we have no idea how common this is.'" This is the paltry evidence Freeman provides for his astonishing claim, and it's been retracted within hours of being published. Way to go, Rolling Stone. That didn't stop the writer, a freelancer whose latest book is about a fire on a Navy ship, from writing a piece that implies gays are heading toward another selfish, disgusting and sickening AIDS Armageddon. The entire lead of the piece is written in a prose style that reads like Jerry Falwell channeling Hunter S. Thompson. Freeman's pseudonymous bug-chaser's eyes "light up as he says that the actual moment of transmission, the instant he gets HIV, will be 'the most erotic thing I can imagine ... But I think it turns the other guy on to know that I'm negative and that they're bringing me into the brotherhood. That gets me off too.'" Freeman elaborates: "HIV-infected semen is treated like liquid gold." Here's one quote from an apparent infecter: "If I know that he's negative and I'm fucking him, it sort of gets me off. I'm murdering him in a sense, killing him slowly, and that's sort of, as sick as it sounds, exciting to me." But then you realize this quote -- relished by Sean Hannity -- isn't from anyone who has infected anyone. It's from Freeman's key source, imagining what it might feel like to be on the other side of the equation. How do we know this guy isn't delusional? We don't. He's clearly deeply disturbed, but we are supposed to believe every word he says. Freeman doesn't actually substantiate a single episode of unsafe sex between someone HIV-negative allegedly seeking infection and someone HIV-positive knowingly passing it on. His source offers to prove it on one occasion. Freeman says he declined to witness the encounter. The piece is also riddled with unbelievably shoddy work. Take this snippet: "With about 40,000 new infections in the United States per year, according to government reports, that would mean around 10,000 each year are attributable to that more liberal definition of bug-chasing." Huh? The 40,000 figure is a Centers for Disease Control number for all HIV infections per year. Anyone with the faintest knowledge of the HIV epidemic knows that men who have sex with men make up a declining number of this group -- now 42 percent, according to the CDC. So even if you buy the bizarre 25 percent figure, you don't end up with 10,000, you end up with 4,200. I mention this obvious point, not because 4,200 is somehow more credible than 10,000. No one, I repeat, no one, has any solid evidence for either figure. I mention it because no serious AIDS journalist would ever write such an ill-informed and obviously fallacious sentence. Any other evidence -- besides the now debunked 25 percent figure -- that the bug-chasing phenomenom is widespread? The piece points to various Web sites where unsafe sex is fetishized. (Oddly, the only Web site cited where bug chasing is allegedly explicitly encouraged no longer carries that message. We are asked to believe that it "recently" did so.) But we knew that already. You can find Web sites all over the place with all sorts of fantasies. And online, our fantasies rule. Just because some people fantasize online under screen names about HIV transmission, it doesn't follow that they actually carry out the act. I'm not saying they don't. I'm just saying we can't tell. Online many people express fantasies or adopt identities precisely because they are an escape from reality. What any serious piece of journalism would do is ask some hard questions and provide some real answers about how widespread this practice actually is. No such answers are found in the piece. None. Again, I'm not saying we should be unconcerned about this phenomenon. It's not made up. It's been out there for years now. It is a problem, as many actual HIV counselors and officials cited in the piece clearly acknowledge. But the first thing a journalist has to do is find out if the phenomenon exists to any real extent, how significant it is, and how widespread it is -- especially when it deploys the most sensational language to describe an already beleaguered and feared subculture. That's why this piece isn't journalism. It's hysteria, wrapped in a homophobic and HIV-phobic wrapper. Sean Hannity and other gay-haters are pleased as punch. Jann Wenner should be ashamed. <N> A slew of online reports in sensationalist news outlets allege that the latest gay sex phenomenon is the sex roulette party, an organized orgy of sorts where one person is HIV positiveand no one knows who. Theres a lot to unpack with these reports. First of all, the assertion that such parties could even be orchestrated is kind of ridiculous. Logistically, in order to guarantee that at least one person at such a party is secretly HIV positive, one of the events planners would have to make sure to invite someone who is HIV positive. In other words, the identity of the HIV positive guest would be known to at least one personmaking it not a secret. Second, there is little evidence to back up the reports that were carried by outlets such as The Sun, The Mirror and The Daily Mail (and later picked up by some gay news outlets). So far, there seems to be only one doctor from Spain and one psychotherapist who have attested to the rise of the gay sex roulette party. Heres how The Daily Mail reported on the story: The parties are usually attended by gay men, who are entertained by the thrill of not knowing whether they will be infected or not. Spanish doctors have noted a rise in the parties where attendees often take anti-viral drugs to reduce the risk of transmission. Dr Josep Mallolas of Hospital Clinic Barcelona said that the parties are a sign that people have lost respect for HIV, reports el Periodico. There is everything: sex roulette parties, or sex parties you can only attend if you already have HIV, he told the outlet. He added that some of the parties are known as blue parties because attendees take anti-viral medication to cut the risk of transmitting the virus. Psychosexual therapist Kate Morley told HelloU: Going to sex roulette parties is about the risk, partygoers think the higher the risk, the stronger the thrill. In the case of sex parties the intense high is as you combine orgasm with high adrenaline. Again, the report seems to only reference one doctor and one psychotherapist. Who are all these other Spanish doctors attesting to the existence of these events? Mainstream coverage of this story is strikingly reminiscent of sensationalist reports from the early 2000s about the alleged rise in bugchasing or gift-giving, the supposed phenomenon in which gay men would actively and purposefully seek to contract HIV. Today, such reports are widely thought to have been hyperbolic fabrications. What do you think of reports of so-called sex roulette parties? [Photo via Ralf Roletschek / fahrradmonteur.de] <N> Claim: A celebrity makes a trip to the emergency room to have a gerbil removed from his rectum. Status: False. Example: [Gibbs and Ross, 1996] The following is a true account: The following is a true account: A 26-year-old male arrives at the ER complaining of rectal bleeding. He is too embarrassed to provide an accurate history but provides the examing doctor a clue: There might be something stuck in my rear end. Examination reveals a non-tender abdomen, but a rectal exam shows blood coming from his anus. A speculum exam reveals bloody stool and a dead gerbil. Apparently, through the cardboard tubing from a paper towel roll, the rodent had been forced into his rectum. Once the animal was in, the tube was pulled out. The idea is that as the gerbil suffocates, it scratches and claws at the lining of the rectum, providing an intense sensation to the patient. The rodent should then have been defecated, but the swelling and bleeding had caused the retention of the animal. The patient required pain medication and antibiotics after the animal was removed, but was then allowed to go home. Origins: Contrary to widespread public belief, gerbil-stuffing is unknown as an actual sexual practice, nor are we aware of a verified medical case of a gerbil having been extracted from a patients rectum. Despite the assiduousness with which doctors record unusual items removed from patients rectums in order to write them up as illustrative cases, we havent yet found a medical journal article involving a gerbil removal. (Doctors, like most people, often repeat urban legends and stories told to them by others as first-person experiences, hence our standard for declaring this true is a peer-reviewed journal article rather than anecdote.) The notion of gerbilling (not necessarily restricted to homosexuals  the insertion of items into the rectum for purposes of autoeroticism is practiced by heterosexuals as well) appears to be pure invention, a tale fabricated to demonstrate the depravity with which faggots allegedly pursue sexual pleasure. (While people do stick all sorts of unusual items up their rectums, they also do so for reasons other than sexual pleasure.) Like similar legends such as The Promiscuous Rock Star, this tale has been applied to various public figures who are known or believed to be homosexual, and it has stuck with one in particular: Richard Gere. Although the legend homed in on various targets when it first appeared (including a Philadelphia newscaster), it has clung tenaciously to Mr. Geres name since at least the mid-1980s. Rumors that he had an emergency gerbilectomy at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in California have spread far and wide, and countless doctors and nurses claim to have participated in, been on hand during, or heard from a reliable colleague about, the procedure. (Cedars-Sinai is apparently the best-staffed hospital in the world, since literally thousands of different doctors and nurses claim to have been on duty at the time Mr. Gere was allegedly brought in for treatment.) The rumors spread was aided by an anonymous prankster who, not long after the film Pretty Woman led to a tremendous increase in Geres popularity, flooded fax machines in Hollywood with a phony press release purportedly issued by the Association for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, claiming that Gere had abused a gerbil. But, as a reporter from The National Enquirer found when he attempted to track down the gerbil story, there were no facts to be had. Versions of the following gerbilling fiction date back at least to 1993 when a faked United Press International item appeared on the Internet, one that named Vito Bustone and Kiki Rodriguez of Lake City, Florida, as the accident victims. (The gerbils name was withheld by request of the family.) Other versions have been falsely attributed to the Los Angeles Times with the events said to have taken place in Salt Lake City, Utah. Rest assured that neither news outlet ever published a news article about these fictitious events: In retrospect, lighting the match was my big mistake. But I was only trying to retrieve the gerbil, Eric Tomaszewski told bemused doctors in the Severe Burns Unit of Salt Lake City Hospital. Tomaszewski, and his homosexual partner Andrew Kiki Farnum, had been admitted for emergency treatment after a felching session had gone seriously wrong. I pushed a cardboard tube up his rectum and slipped Raggot, our gerbil, in, he explained. As usual, Kiki shouted out Armageddon, my cue that hed had enough. I tried to retrieve Raggot but he wouldnt come out again, so I peered into the tube and struck a match, thinking the light might attract him. At a hushed press conference, a hospital spokesman described what happened next. The match ignited a pocket of intestinal gas and a flame shot out the tube, igniting Mr. Tomaszewskis hair and severely burning his face. It also set fire to the gerbils fur and whiskers which in turn ignited a larger pocket of gas further up the intestine, propelling the rodent out like a cannonball. Tomaszewski suffered second degree burns and a broken nose from the impact of the gerbil, while Farnum suffered first and second degree burns to his anus and lower intestinal tract. Sightings: Look for some tongue-in-cheek references to the Gere-bil in the 1996 film Scream. Also, passing mention is made to this rumor during a student bull session in 1998s Urban Legend. As well, in an episode of televisions The Vicar of Dibley (The Easter Bunny; original air date 8 April 1996), Geraldine (Dawn French) remarks upon Richard Geres sexiness by saying she wouldnt have minded being the hamster. Last updated: 18 November 2001 <N> [Collected via e-mail, 2000] If you read one disgusting story this year . . . LET IT BE THIS ONE ! Susy DeLucci and the Miracle of Life. One morning around 5am 22 year old Susan DaLucci of Kittery Maine, woke up with a painful need to urinate. At first she thought she had diarrhea, but when she stood up out of bed, she realized that it was urinary pain. It was very similar to the feeling of having diarrhea, just out the wrong hole. She wobbled to the toilet and upon sitting on it, her vagina erupted into the most horrific messy farting noise anyone has ever heard. In paralyzing pain, Ms. DeLucci for the next few minutes continued to push and squirt out of her vagina a burning tide of wretch and filth while she gripped the sides of the toilet, white-knuckled. She was screaming wildly, and the neighbors called the police. When medics arrived they found Ms. DeNucci unconscious lying on the floor of her bathroom wearing nothing but her bath robe. Running down her leg, was a stream of brown and green syrup. The medic had to transfer her to a stretcher, so he grabbed her left leg which was bent crossing her other leg, to straighten her out. She was lying there all twisted up. When he lifted her left leg to straighten her body out, he exposed her vagina at which point a creature, no larger than the tip of a finger wormed its way out of her genitals and landed on the floor with a wet popping sound. Shocked, the medic stared at the creature that was lying on the tile bathroom floor in a casing of mucous. It was a tiny mud shrimp and it sat there on the cold floor gasping for water while flipping itself back and forth. The horrified medic turned to the toilet as he felt the nausea setting in. When he put his face down into the toilet to puke what he saw was so horrific that to this day he cannot look into a toilet without convulsing. The entire toilet bowl was boiling with baby brown mud shrimp flipping and splashing at a furious pace. If you think that is bad  wait until you hear how it happened: Ms. DeLucci official death was the result of a combination of shock and severe head trauma. She stood up over the toilet in pain and when she saw what she had done, she went into shock and fell, smashing her head on the toilet and then on the floor. It is believed by medical police that on two nights before the accident she had purchased a live lobster at a fish market. While lying in a tub, she gently inserted the creatures tail into her vagina to derive pleasure. At that point, she held a lighter under the creatures face causing it to flip its tail in a violent snapping motion. <N> Savage Love Swap Meet Joe Newton On our way home from dinner with friends, my wife and I enjoy talking about who among our friends we could imagine having sex with. These conversations get especially interesting when the woman I could imagine having sex with is married to the man my wife could imagine having sex with. Naturally, this raises the question of a "swap." Is there a protocol for suggesting to another couple that they entertain the idea of a "swap?" Or does it just require getting everyone really drunk? Just Curious Robert McGinley is President of the North American Swing Club Association (NASCA), has a Ph.D. in psychology, and has been called the "swingers' guru" more times than he cares to remember. "In my experience, it is not a wise idea, and rarely successful, to try to introduce one's dinner companions to swinging unless you're sure that couple is interested or already involved in swing activities," Robert said when I shared your letter with him. "Good friends are hard to find, so why risk mucking up a friendship by making an advance? Also, if the other couple is shocked, they may tell others of your advance, affecting other friendships. Far better to go to a swing club, one that is couple-oriented, and make new friends who are already into swinging." Robert would give that advice, wouldn't he? As the head of a trade association for swing clubs, it's Robert's job to direct horny married couples to NASCA's paying members, and discourage freelance swinging. But conflicts of interest aside, I have to say I agree with Robert. When it comes to major kink--and swinging is major--it's best to meet like-minded pervs through like-minded perv organizations or at like-minded perv bars or parties. At NASCA's inevitable website (www.nasca.com), you'll find listings for swing clubs all over the world. "Look up clubs in the state you live in," Robert suggested, "and call the clubs that sound interesting." I went online and found eight clubs where you live, JC. What kind of people will you meet? "Couples involved in swinging are the cream of the crop," said Robert--but again, Robert would have to say that. The head of NASCA is not going to say, "swingers are scum," is he? But once again, I'm going to back Robert up: Some of my best friends are swingers, and some are the cream of the crop. "The last study I saw put the median age for men at 39, and 36 for women," Robert said. "These people are married, they have careers, they have families. Swinging is a couples activity. They have their act together and know what's what." But what if you're attracted to one particular couple who aren't swingers? Should you get them drunk--a move I recommend frequently--and make a pass? "Oh, boy, that is a no-no from the word go," said Robert. "Even if it works, there can be a lot of repercussions once everyone sobers up. And why would you want to be drunk when you have sex? Getting drunk greatly inhibits the ability to be sexual. Swinging should always be entered into by knowledgeable, sober, consenting adults." This is where Robert and I part company. Yeah, yeah, yeah; everything should be entered into by knowledgeable, sober, consenting adults--but that's not the way the world works when the world wants to get off, is it? My advice: Get your friends blasted and work swinging into the conversation. There's a new documentary film about swinging called The Lifestyle, and it's making the rounds on the festival circuit. See it, or claim to have seen it, and tell your friends about it--when they're blasted. Without saying anything pro-swing or con-swing, feel your friends out on the swap topic. If they're pro-swing, pounce--make that pass. If they're con-swing, get 'em a little drunker, and see if they don't come around to a pro-swing position. In addition to his many duties at NASCA, Robert also runs the Lifestyle Organization, whose 26th annual convention will be held in Reno, Nevada this weekend--where everyone will be stone-cold sober, no doubt. "There'll be four dances," Robert told me, "and seminars on sexuality, relationships, growth, and medical issues--and a lot of socializing." But no drinking, of course. You can get more info about the convention by visiting--you guessed it--Lifestyle Organization's inevitable website, www.lifestyles.org. Before I let Robert off the phone, I had one more question: Has the late '90s resurgence of swing dancing resulted in the North American Swing Club Association getting calls from people looking for dance lessons and not pervy, middle-aged married couples? "Yeah," Robert said, laughing. "Not very many, but some. We tell them we're not swing dancers. They laugh, say they're sorry, and go away." My fianc and I were frequently intimate when we were boyfriend and girlfriend. But since we got engaged, we haven't done much. Any advice? Really Curious Don't get married. Have you heard of a gay sex practice called "decanting"? As it was told to me, one man catheterizes himself to empty his bladder, and then refills his bladder with wine to serve to guests at a very posh gay club. Is this real? While not universally appealing, urine is sterile and the bladder is a very clean place. Is a glass filled from the penis, or does it go directly into the mouth? Any light you could shed on this would be great. Curious No, I haven't heard of "decanting," nor have I heard of "mudslides" (gay men crapping and pissing in a room filled with dirt), nor "donkey punching" (gay men knocking their sex partners out with a blow to the back of the head as they fuck), nor "booger planting" (gay men with small penises fucking gay men with large noses in the nostrils), nor "pigs in a blanket" (gay men wrapping sausages in pancakes and serving them to friends with butter and syrup), nor any of the other bizarre and implausible "gay" sex practices straight people are absolutely obsessed with. Are any of these things "real?" Only in the imaginations of some straight people whose sex lives are so dull, they have to make up bullshit about mine. Speaking of bullshit: Just Shoot Me star David Spade used the word "fag" in an interview with Playboy magazine, sending the fags over at the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation into a press-release writing frenzy. Spade joked that Just Shoot Me producers were constantly trying "to fag me up... [but] when I get too faggy, they have me make out with a chick." GLAAD spokesfag Scott Seomin slammed Spade for using "derogatory" and "hurtful" terms, claiming "fag" and "faggy" are comparable to "racial or ethnic slurs," and demanded that Spade apologize. David, don't worry about anything GLAAD says--most gays and lesbians don't--and don't apologize. If Scott Seomin didn't find things to get upset about, he'd be out of a job. The vast majority of gays and lesbians use the word "fag" as a noun, a verb, and an adjective, and "fag" really isn't comparable to racial or ethnic slurs like, oh, say, nigger or kike. Gays and lesbians have "Dyke Marches," wear T-shirts with fruit jokes on them, and chant "fags and dykes and queers, oh my!" at demonstrations. The word is so commonly used by gay men that we can't object when straight comedians use it too, and in the exact same way we do: not as a slur, but as a joke. Get over it, GLAAD. _EMAIL_ <N> Normally, a background section gives an historical narrative of an authors personal and professional life. But I like this interview, done years ago by a web magazine in Washington D.C. Ive edited it for relevance and updated it a bit to reflect changes in my life. I find it more informative and full of life than a standard bio. I hope you agree. Can you tell us a little about your background? I was born and raised near Minneapolis. Perhaps the most formative experience of my childhood was going out with my father, who worked for the Red Cross, when he went to help victims of fires and floods who had lost their homes, their possessions, and, sometimes, their families. He would get the same calls as the fire department, and we would often arrive simultaneously, often in the deepest night, and confront the same tragedies the police and firemen confronted, only our responsibility was to provide aid and comfort. These experiences gave me a profound understanding of human suffering and hope, and left me with an indelible belief in a life of service. They also taught me how fragile our good fortune is, and how lucky and blessed I have been to live the life Ive lived. After high school I went to the University of Minnesota in American Studies, then to Stanford University in Religious Studies and Humanities, then to Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, where I received a Ph.D. in conjunction with the University of California at Berkeley. My doctorate was in Religious Studies and Art. For many years I devoted my life to creating over-life sized sculptures from tree trunks. My heroes and mentors were Michelangelo, Donatello, and Rodin, all of whose works I had the good fortune to study in person while living for a time in Europe. After returning to Minnesota, I moved north to the pine and lake country near the Canadian border, where my wife and I got married and have lived ever since. For several years I worked on the Red Lake Ojibwe reservation helping students collect the memories of the tribal elders. This changed my life and introduced me to the native spiritual traditions that have become so central to the message in my writings. I switched to writing from sculpture about 30 years ago when I realized that I could reach more people as a writer and that I had skills in that area. My work has been a constant search, from various perspectives, for an authentic American spirituality, integrating our western Judeo-Christian tradition with the other traditions of the world, and especially the indigenous spirituality of the people who first inhabited this continent. Someone once called me a guerilla theologian, and I think that is fairly accurate. I am deeply concerned with the human condition and our responsibility to the earth, the people on it, and the generations to come. I believe that we are, at heart, spiritual beings seeking spiritual meaning, and I try to honor this search wherever I discover it in the course of my daily life. My wife and I currently live just outside of Portland, Oregon, where we moved after her retirement from Bemidji State University, partly to be near some of our grandchildren and partly because I figured that continuing to climb on roofs to pull down snow in our northern Minnesota winters was going to bring me to a bad end. Nonetheless, we do miss our lives amid the great powerful forces of the Minnesota north, where the winter winds blew unstopped from the vast Manitoba prairies, and on beautiful summer nights we were serenaded to sleep by the songs of loons and the lapping of waters on the lake outside our window. But times change and the seasons of life turn. The Pacific Northwest with its lush beauty and proximity to the monumental presences of oceans and mountains has been a wonderful revelation and has allowed us to see life through new eyes. It has been a move we dont regret. I have four children  three who came in the package deal with my wife, each wonderful and interesting in his or her own right, and each now well into adulthood and building careers and family. The fourth, my biological son, is a fascinating documentarian photographer and filmmaker. We are fortunate that he got the best parts of each of his parents. As you know, it doesnt always work that way. We have three grandchildren, and find that all the clichs about grandparenting are real. What a joy and gift they are. Your writing seems very poetic in style. Is this something you do consciously, or is this just the way the words flow out? I take the music of language very seriously. Like a heartbeat, it exists right below consciousness, but it animates and infuses your language with life. As both a reader and a writer, I tend to subvocalize, thus making my pacing and thoughts more auditory than conceptual. I want the sentences to aspirate and pulsate with cadence and internal music. A good sentence should sound good and feel good and roll comfortably off your tongue, not simply serve as a conveyor for ideas. Who inspires you? Donatello, Rilke, Nelson Mandela, Black Elk, Bach, Mahler, Lao Tzu, good elementary school teachers, caring nursing home workers, and anyone who spends time with people who can offer them no benefit. You quote the Sioux writer Ohiyesa in Small Graces: The Quiet Gifts of Everyday Life. Do you have a favorite quote or thought of his? I constantly hark back in my own life to his comment about spirituality: Whenever, in the course of our day, we might come upon a scene that is strikingly beautiful or sublime  the black thundercloud with the rainbows glowing arch above the mountain; a white waterfall in the heart of a green gorge; a vast prairie tinged with the blood-red of sunset  we pause for an instant in an attitude of worship. This, it seems to me, is the key to a humble appreciation of the gift of life we have been given and a proper way of honoring the Great Mystery we have come to call God. What makes you hopeful about the future? I am hopeful for human beings because I believe that, at heart, we all seek the same thing  a chance to love and be loved, to raise good children, and to live in peace with our neighbors and families. That we so consistently fail to do so is troubling. And I admit to being deeply upset by the selfishness that is abroad in our own land  believing that we must look out first and foremost for ourselves (though perhaps that may be changing)  and the tendency, both here and abroad, to use religious belief to justify cruelty toward others. Do you have a favorite writer or book? I love Graham Greene, Jim Harrison, Annie Dillard, Barry Lopez, and Rainer Maria Rilke. When you write, do you ever feel that something greater than yourself is providing the words or ideas? Alas, no. I wish I did. But I do believe that we are all Gods hands here on earth, and that in and through my writing I must endeavor to do Gods work, however one chooses to define or give a shape to God. I do know that there are moments when writing feels like a walk in a beautiful garden, and the joy of discovery is everywhere around me. At those times I feel myself in the presence of something close to Grace, though it seems more like a gift that I must honor than a channeling of some outside force. You write about experiences youve had that suggest youve studied with various spiritual traditions. Whats been particularly helpful or pivotal in your path? I love the Beatitudes from the Christian tradition, the use of natural forces as analogy in the Taoist tradition, and the spiritual commitment to the power of the earth in the Native American traditions. I believe we are our brothers and sisters keepers, that the ways of force and acquiescence shown in nature must govern an integrated and balanced life, and that each person must, indeed, find his or her own spiritual path and live each day with an attitude of prayerful awareness. Do you recommend spending time in nature? Let me quote Ohiyesa again. All who have lived much out of doors, whether Indian or otherwise, know that there is a magnetic and powerful force that accumulates in solitude but is quickly dissipated by life in a crowd. We should all seek the healing and clarifying power of nature so that our spiritual focus and power is not allowed to dissipate. You talk about the importance of ritual in Small Graces. Are there any rituals or practices youd recommend to someone seeking a more spiritually focused life? Prayer  not as petition, but as reflection and contemplation. Mentoring. Service with no thought of recognition. I know these are not specific. But each person must find his or her specific expression of these general principles. Helping a child or an elder or someone in need will do more for ones spiritual focus than closing any deal or building any building or achieving any position of fame or celebrity. Ignatius Loyola said it simply and best: Anything we turn toward God is a prayer. You have a lot of wonderful quotes at the beginning of each chapter of Small Graces. Is there one thats particularly special to you? I believe in them all. But I would think that the essence of my philosophy about life is in the quote, We are not all called to be great. But we are all called to reach out our hands to our brothers and sisters, and to care for the earth in the time we are given. Do you have any final thoughts youd like to share? Seek the unseen in life. Celebrate the ordinary. Serve the weak rather than currying the favor of the powerful. Find a way to direct your life towards God. And live for the seventh generation rather than for yourself. Most of all, follow the invitation of the Lakota chief, Sitting Bull, Come, let us put our minds together to see what kind of life we can create for our children. And remember that we do not all live holy lives, but we all live in a world alive with holy moments. Thank you so much for your time. <N> A website out of the U.K., zenmoments.org, has recently posted the now well-traveled story of my experience as a cab driver, when I picked up an old woman who was on her way to a hospice. It has reached number one on a number of websites as a result. I am thrilled when my ordinary life offers up an extraordinary moment that brings some solace or insight or enjoyment to others, and such has been the good fortune of that moment in the late 1980s when I was driving the dog shift in Minneapolis, Minnesota. What is noteworthy about that moment, beyond its poignancy, is that I did not create it; I merely experienced it and let it unfold. Life gives us all such moments  I call them Blue Moments (See Letters to My Son for an explanation)  where a brilliant light shines through the ordinary moments in our ordinary days. They come unsolicited and unannounced, and provide us the gift of significance and, if we are lucky, the opportunity to serve. What it is important is to remember that these ARE gifts, and that we cannot receive them if we are not open to them. We need to listen closely, watch closely, and take care not to rush past or through them when they arrive. They are the fabric of our lives, and they will weave themselves with complexity and beauty if we give them time to do so. I bring this up because Id like to make you two offers  one big and one small. The small one first: If any of you would like to read the original piece, unmodified and in the context in which it was written, I would like to offer you the opportunity to buy a signed copy of Make Me an Instrument of Your Peace: Living in the Spirit of the Prayer of St. Francis. It is one of my lesser known books, but one of my favorites. In it, I tried to write an extended meditation on each of the lines of Francis famous prayer and to illuminate them with stories from my life and the lives of others. The cab ride story is one of those. The second offer  the big one  is made to all of you, but especially you readers in the U.K. I will be in the U.K. next spring. The exact dates are not yet set, but they will likely occur in April and early May. If you would like to have me come to speak to any group of yours, please contact me and we can try to make the arrangements. The same holds true for any group anywhere in America. I enjoy going out to speak because it allows me to meet my readers. It also allows me to share some of the stories and insights that my journey through lifes blue moments has offered. So, thank you again for your continued interest in my work. I will keep trying to earn your trust by doing my best in everything I write. It is the least I can do to honor the faith you have shown in me. <N> Hot Convict Jeremy Meeks says hes eager to serve out his sentence and is looking ahead to starting a career in modeling and acting. Im in a place where I will be able to provide for my family and really change my life, Meeks told ABC News from a Nevada prison. I never thought that everyone in the world would recognize me for my looks, so I feel extremely blessed and very thankful. The chisel-jawed, blue-eyed Californian became an Internet sensation last year when his mug shot went viral after the Stockton Police Department posted it on its page. Meeks was sentenced several weeks ago to 27 months of prison on weapon charges, but hopes for a November release that accounts for time served and good behavior. Meeks is now working with agent Jim Jordan of White Cross Management and said he plans to take full advantage of his viral fame. In preparation for his release and foray into modeling, Meeks said that he is working on getting ripped. I eat healthy. I do a lot of push-ups, pull-ups, dips, burpees, and I stay very active, he said. Meeks said he wants to try his hand at both modeling and acting. I wish I could be on a show like 'Sons of Anarchy,' said Meeks. Jordan is confident Meeks notoriety can propel him into a successful career. There is a sea of opportunities waiting for him, Jordon said, who is working to set Meeks up with modeling agencies around the world, endorsement deals and reality show interests. As for that mug shot, Meeks said he wasn't intentionally giving his best blue steel for the picture. I was just thinking about missing my family, he said. I was really thinking about my son a lot at that moment, that was the only thing that was on my mind. Until then, Meeks said he is keeping his head down and relying on backing from the outside. I've got a lot of support my family, my friends, and from my fans -- I get hundreds and hundreds of letters every month. Im very thankful for all the support I've been getting, Meeks said. <N> This sermon delivered by Russell Conwell to his Grace Baptist (Temple) church congregation in 1912 is presented here due to inquiries about this story based on a slightly inaccurate version which some people have read elsewhere. Please note that the portrait referred to in the text is the property of the current Baptist Temple congregation which is located in Blue Bell, PA. An image of the portrait can be found at the end of this sermon. The portrait itself is not on the campus of Temple University. Note also, that the Samaritan Hospital referred to in the text is now the Temple University Hospital. The Baptist Temple building referred to in the text is now owned by the University. Although it is not currently in use, it is undergoing extensive renovation. It is not open to the public at this time, but should eventually be open once again when all the renovations are completed. The Wiatt Mite Society house referred to in the text was replaced by a new University building some time ago. "THE HISTORY OF FIFTY-SEVEN CENTS" Sermon By Russell H. Conwell Sunday Morning, December 1, 1912. We are here to unveil this picture of Hattie May Wiatt, a little girl who died in 1886. Years have gone rapidly by, but she still speaks. We intend to put this picture in the pastor's study, in the most prominent place, and keep it there through the years to come, that people as they pass through may ask: "What meaneth that picture?" And the story, simple and wonderful, may be told. Little Hattie May Wiatt lived in a house near the church in which we then worshipped, at Berks and Mervine, which is now occupied by the Christian Church. It was a small church and was crowded, tickets of admission were obtained sometimes weeks in advance for every service. The Sunday school was as crowded as the rest of the congregation, and one day when I came down to the church, to attend Sabbath school, I found a number of children outside. They were greatly disturbed because they could not get in, on account of the crowd of children already in the Sunday school rooms of the church, and little Hattie May Wiatt, who lived near by, had brought her books and a contribution, and was standing by the gate, hesitating whether to go back home or wait and try to get in later. I took her up in my arms, lifted her to my shoulder, and then as she held on to my head - an embrace I never can forget - I carried her through the crowd in the hall, into the Sunday school room, and seated her in a chair away back in a dark corner. The next morning as I came down to the church from my home I came by their house and she was going up the street to school. As we met, I said: "Hattie, we are going to have a larger Sunday school room soon", and she said: "I hope you will. It is so crowded that I am afraid to go there alone". "Well", I replied, "When we get the money with which to erect a school building we are going to construct one large enough to get all the little children in, and we are going to begin very soon to raise the money for it". It was only in my mind as a kind of imaginary vision, but I wished to make conversation with the child. The next that I heard about it was that Hattie was very sick, and they asked me to come in and see the child, which I did, and prayed with her. I walked up the street, praying for the little girl's recovery, and yet all the time with the conviction that it was not to be. Hattie May Wiatt died. She had gathered 57 cents - some have written 54 - which was left as her contribution towards securing another building for the children. After the funeral the mother handed me the little bag with the gathered 57 cents. I took it to the church and stated that we had the first gift toward the new Sunday school building; that little Hattie May Wiatt, who had gone on into the Shining World, had left behind her this gift towards it. I then changed all the money into pennies and offered them for sale. I received about $250 for the 57 pennies; and 54 of those cents were returned to me by the people who bought them. I then had them put in a frame where they could be seen and exhibited them, and we received by a sale of the $250 changed into pennies money enough to buy the next house north of the church at Berks and Mervine. That house was bought by the Wiatt Mite Society, which was organized for the purpose of taking the 57 cents and enlarging on them sufficiently to buy the property for the Primary Department of the Sunday school. In the Wiatt Mite Society was Mr. Edward O. Elliott ( now one of our trustees) who has charge of this picture, and was then a member. Then when the crowd became so great we could no longer get in there, the thought impressed itself upon our congregation, "We ought to have a larger church and a larger Sunday school room". Faith in God was the characteristic of this people, and they said, "We can do it", notwithstanding the fact that the church had a mortgage on it then, I think, of $30,000, and that we had no money in advance. Yet the conviction was strong that we ought to build a larger church, and some ventured so far, though then it seemed absurd, to say that we might "build on Broad Street somewhere". But the Wiatt Mite Society, using the influence of Hattie May Wiatt's first deposit, raised the money to pay, as I said, for the house, and then the undertaking was before us, whether we would go out and try to build a large church. I walked over to see Mr. Baird, who lived on the corner where the German Athletic Association now has its meetings, and asked him what he wanted for this lot on which the Temple now stands. He said that he wanted $30,000. I told him that we had only 54 cents toward the $30,000, but that we were foolish enough to think that some time we would yet own that lot. Encouraged by what he said, and with no opposition on the part of the Board of Deacons, I went around again to talk with him, and asked him if he would not hold the lot for five years. Mr. Baird said: "I have been thinking this matter over and have made up my mind I will sell you that lot for $25,000, taking $5,000 less than I think it is worth, and I will take the 54 cents as the first payment and you may give me a mortgage for the rest at 5%. I went back and so reported to the church, and they said: "Well, we can raise more money that 54 cents", but I went over and left the 54 cents with Mr. Baird and took a receipt for it as a part payment on the lot. Mr. Baird afterwards returned the 54 cents as another gift. Thus we bought the lot, and thus encouraged of God step by step, we went on constructing this building. We owed $109,000 when it was done, but we had courage and faith in God then. We could hardly have dreamed then that in the number of years that followed this people, without wealth, each giving only as he could afford from his earnings, could have paid off so great a debt without any outside help. The only outside help that we really received was from Mr. Bucknell. Although our church was then called the Grace Baptist Church, he was not willing that we should call the new building a church until the mortgage was paid. He gave us $10,000 on the condition that we call this building by some other name than the Grace Baptist Church, and that accounts for its being called The Temple instead of the Grace Church. Afterwards, when we did pay off the mortgage accounts, we dedicated the building and have a right now to call it whatever we choose, but after 21 years of being named as it is, there is no reason why we should change it, and there is no hope of doing so if we should undertake it. It will always be known as The Temple. I must state here also that in the house purchased by the sale of the 57 cents was organized The Temple University. Now, giving simply that brief introduction to the history of Hattie May Wiatt, I wish to call your attention to two or three important lessons in connection with it: Who are the really great of this world? Who are the mighty? Is it the king, the emperor, the president, the famous, estimated by the kingdom of heaven and on the books of God? How little we know. Our nation has given credit to Washington, to Jefferson, to Lafayette,t o the great Pitt of England, to the great generals and writers, and to great financiers like Morris, but there is one person hardly over mentioned in our history who had so much influence in our affairs that as a nation we ought to have her picture in every public hall and in every school; yet because she was a young woman she seems to have been lost to the sight of the world. That was the Princess Elizabeth, sister of Louis XVI, of France. That little woman who was a treasure of femine loveliness, with a heart as pure and bright as any that ever beat in the breast of woman; she who lived in the aristocracy of that time, but who plead for the starving, common people and protested again against Marie Antoinette's use of the public money as she did at Versailles, and spent her life in charity and loving kindness. She laid the foundation for the victory of this nation. Those who read history know that we could not have hoped for freedom if Rochambeau had not come to this country, if the French had not indorsed us, and if the French had not fought England on the waters and lands of Europe while we were trying to fight our battles here. If it had not been for Yorktown and its surrender we could never have hoped to obtain our freedom from what was then the tyrannous king of England. Who sent Rochambeau, who used the influence that brought his coming about? In some of the correspndence of Benjamin Franklin, who represented us at the Court of France, we find that the princess, a lovely young woman, was well acquainted with him and liked to talk with him upon philosophy and upon American ideas. She served as a "go-between" with Franklin and the queen, who used her influence with the king; for Louis XVI reminds one of Henry Ward Beecher's statement with reference to his church in Ohio, when he said: "It had only 19 members, 18 were women and the other one was nothing". Louis XVI was really nothing, and Marie Antoinette was the power indeed behind the throne, and behind Marie Antoinette was the Princess Elizabeth. It was she who opened the way for Franklin to reach the ear of the king. It was she who went to the Prime Minister of France and secured from him the condemnation of the arms, which were sold for a few cents apiece to America, yet were just as good as the best made in the world. It was she who secured the influence of the king to declare war on England in order that he might help America to her liberty. It was that young woman, acting all the time with continued energy, with prayer as well as with her social influence as one of the royal family, who really secured to us our liberty. Yet how little is said of her. In the great records of the history of mankind she should occupy a leading place. When I think of that innocent, sweet woman going to the guillotine on that morning in the old cart, encouraging all the humbler ones in the cart with her to keep up t heir courage, to hold their faith in God and to believe in a future world; when I see that noble, patriotic martyr going to that great square where she was beheaded, I see one of the great martyrs of earth. Yet in history, I say, we find our nation remarkably silent concerning her. And so in the history of Hattie May Wiatt - the name is new to some of you. She was a school girl, living in one of the homes of the industrious, honorable, upright and saving classes of society, not of the wealthy and great, yet think how her life was used; think what God did with her and the great, yet think how her life was used; thaink what God did with her and the 54 cents that was used of hers. A glance at it would put many to shame. Think of this large church; think of the membership added to it - over 5600 - since that time. Think of the influence of its membership going out and spreading over the world. Think of the influence of the Sabbath school carried on in this great building for more than twenty years. Then think of the institutions this church founded. Think of the Samaritan Hospital and the thousands of sick people that have been cured there, and the thousands of poor that are ministered to every year. I received the report of the Samaritan Hospital for October last Saturday and find that during the month 2540 had visited the dispensary. By multiplying that by twelve to get the average for a year, we find that over 30,000 people every year go to the dispensary of that one hospital, and that does not include the inner wards for the poor or the private rooms. Then there is the other hopital, the Garrestson, also taken up by the poeple of this church. Without this church, it could never have been started. There they ministered in one single year to over 14,000 workmen, wounded and broken and dying. When we think, I say, of the ministrations of these hospitals that were started by the influence of this church and supported in the .... in the beginning by members of this church, what a long roll it is of the deeds of Christian kindness. Think of how in that Wiatt house were begun the very first classes of the Temple College. The Wiatt Mite Society provided the seats, the books and the teachers. Thus it began as an evening school, and it has gone on growing and developing through the years. That house, bought for 54 cents in the first place, was sold and the proceeds given to the Temple College in order that it might open on Park avenue, and when we moved out of the original church that was given bodily to the Temple College, and the college sold it to the Christian Church and used the money to erect a building next door to us on Broad Street. Think of the influence of that 57 cents just for a moment. Almost 80,000 young people have gone through the classes of the Temple University, and think where they are. A year ago we estimated that there were 500 young men and women in the business department who earned nothing before they went there and who, after six months' instruction, were earning from $5 to $15 a week. Think of the added income, of the added comforts, which even the smallest departments had given, and then think of the Departments of Law, Medicine, Dentistry, Theology, Household Arts, the Normal School and the Teachers' College - nearly 4000 are now going in and out its various doors in various parts of the city. Just estimate how they will go and teach thousands more, and how those thousands will in turn teach many thousands more in their lifetime; think how it sweeps the world in a century with one techer, multiplying himself or herself a hundred times, perhaps, nearly every year. Two years ago - the smallest year of that work, - we took statistics of the Temple University students to learn their religious connection, and, of course, we found all kinds of religions because it is an undenominational institution. We ascertained that 504 young men of all denominations were studying for the Gospel ministry, in a single year. Now, if we graduate - and certainly we do - at least a hundred a year into the ministry of the various denominations, think what must have come to pass in twenty years. Think of it - two thousand people preaching the Gospel because Hattie May Wiatt invested her 54 cents; because she laid the foundations and gave her life for it. I wish I had time to extend these remarks until you could realize more than one can without details. But I want to draw one or two more lessons and at once. In the first place, the people had faith in God, and they went ahead, trusting Him, and He has followed all the way. He has kept and protected us through every step with great care, and the future is just as safe, certainly, as is the past. Hattie May Wiatt was being used to do a mighty work. We sometimes think that when a life stops in eight years, or in ten, it is a shortened life, and that it is a broken life, that it was never completed. But in God's sight, every life is complete. Whether taken at eight, ten, twenty, thirty, fifty, or seventy years, every life is complete, when God takes it; hence, that is the case with the life of Hattie May Wiatt. Think of the sorrow that was in that home. I shall never forget the broken-hearted state of the family and friends who came to the funeral. Think of that mother sorrowing through all these years. I am making her heart more tender every moment as I speak, I am arousing within her the memory of those days which a mother can never forget. But Hattie died at the right time, she was called of God at exactly the moment when it was best for earth and for the kingdom to come that she should go. Her life was filled out, it was complete, and when we think of the influence of it upon the world, upon all the ages, we feel as though she was one of the greatest of earth who had accomplished that which leaders of armies had failed to do, and that which kings upon their thrones could not accomplish. Her life was just as long as any other. The other thought that I would have dwelled upon if I had the time, is that being dead she yet speaks. Men may have powers of eloquence, they may sing with all the sweetness of angelic voices, and yet they may not speak as Hattie May Wiatt speaks tonight, as she will speak through your life as you go out and do differently from what you would have done if you had not been here. Hattie May Wiatt is speaking in tones of eloquence, sweet, divine and powerful, moving on upon the ages. Many men are counted great, many men are given credit for that which they do not do, but here is a life filled with motive power that sweeps on for all time. Twenty years and more have gone, and is she twenty years older in Heaven? When her mother meets her there will she be twenty years older than she was when she went? When that little lad brought five loaves and two small fishes to be used of Christ for His great work of feeding the five thousand, it was precisely the same thing that Hattie May Wiatt did when she brought her 57 cents, and that lad and Hattie May Wiatt are now in the land on high. Does she see us? Yes, she does. It is one of the great comforts of life that every person is used of God, that every individual is loved just as closely and in careful detail as though he were the only person on this earth. Think of that, my brother, my sister, if there were not another person living on earth God could not take any more individual care of you than He now does. He sees and knows you; though you may think your life is humble, unknown, hidden, yet God sees all, and your life has probably just as great an influence for the uplift of mankind and the progress of His kingdom as has been the life of those who are seemingly great, seemingly famous in this world. There is no difference before God. The humblest of His Christian servants is doing just as much for His kingdom, when waiting, or doing faithfully their little duty, as are the seemingly great; and Hattie May Wiatt looks down from the towers of Heaven upon this world and sees all these myriads of powerful influences moving out upon the earth and shaping the course of the world beyond anything we can dream. She is happy on high with the thought that her life was so full, that it was so complete, that she lived really to be so old in the influences she threw upon this earth. ******** Retyped from the publication of the sermon in The Temple Review , the weekly magazine of the Baptist Temple, v.21, no.7, December 19, 1912.

The first appeared in Applied Optics [11(8) A14 (1972), August]. It applies the physics of thermodynamics to conclude that Heaven is hotter than Hell. The second is a response that combines Biblical evidence with thermodynamics to argue that, while heaven is devilishly hot, Hell is hotter still. It appeared in the Journal of Irreproducible Results in 1979. While the first paper is well known, and available many places on the web, the follow-up isn't as well known. It is included here, for the first time on the net, in the interest of fairly presenting both sides of this burning debate on a hot issue. Cartoon  1988 by John C. Holden* HEAVEN IS HOTTER THAN HELL The temperature of heaven can be rather accurately computed. Our authority is the Bible, Isaiah 30:26 reads, Moreover, the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold as the light of seven days. Thus, heaven receives from the moon as much radiation as the earth does from the sun, and in addition seven times seven (forty nine) times as much as the earth does from the sun, or fifty times in all. The light we receive from the moon is one ten-thousandth of the light we receive from the sun, so we can ignore that. With these data we can compute the temperature of heaven: The radiation falling on heaven will heat it to the point where the heat lost by radiation is just equal to the heat received by radiation. In other words, heaven loses fifty times as much heat as the earth by radiation. Using the Stefan-Boltzmann fourth power law for radiation (H/E)4 = 50 The temperature of heaven can be rather accurately computed. Our authority is the Bible, Isaiah 30:26 reads,Thus, heaven receives from the moon as much radiation as the earth does from the sun, and in addition seven times seven (forty nine) times as much as the earth does from the sun, or fifty times in all. The light we receive from the moon is one ten-thousandth of the light we receive from the sun, so we can ignore that. With these data we can compute the temperature of heaven: The radiation falling on heaven will heat it to the point where the heat lost by radiation is just equal to the heat received by radiation. In other words, heaven loses fifty times as much heat as the earth by radiation. Using the Stefan-Boltzmann fourth power law for radiation where E is the absolute temperature of the earth, 300K (273+27). This gives H the absolute temperature of heaven, as 798 absolute (525C). The exact temperature of hell cannot be computed but it must be less than 444.6C, the temperature at which brimstone or sulfur changes from a liquid to a gas. Revelations 21:8: But the fearful and unbelieving... shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone." A lake of molten brimstone [sulfur] means that its temperature must be at or below the boiling point, which is 444.6C. (Above that point, it would be a vapor, not a lake.) We have then, temperature of heaven, 525C . Temperature of hell, less than 445C . Therefore heaven is hotter than hell. This version differs from some on the net, and has been faithfully copied from the version in Applied Optics. The misprint in the exponent of the equation has been corrected, and one insertion added, in square brackets. The author of this piece is probably Paul Darwin Foote, published anonymously in a 1920 publication of the Taylor Instrument Company. The Applied Optics version was prefaced by "The following reached your Managing Editor via John Howard (from) H. William Koch (from) Alan Bromley (from) an unnamed environmental physicist of several decades back." A REFUTATION OF THE PROOF THAT HEAVEN IS HOTTER THAN HELL Dr. Tim Healey, F. R. C. R.; M. I. Nuc. E. In Applied Optics (1972, 11 A14) there appeared a calculation of the respective temperatures of Heaven and Hell. That of Heaven was computed by substituting the values given in Isaiah 30 26 [1] in the Stefan-Boltzman radiation law, so that (H/E)4 = 50, where E, the absolute temperature of the Earth, is 300K, whence the temperature of Heaven, H, is 798K or 525C. This is hard to find fault with. The assessment of the temperature of Hell stands, I suggest, on less firm ground. As authority we use the data provided in Revelations 21 8 [2], so that the temperature of Hell seems to be 444.6Cthe temperature at which liquid sulfur is in equilibrium with its vapoura temperature indeed which is sufficiently reliable to be used in the secondary calibration of pyrometers. Now this last reckoning fails to follow the argument through. 444.6C is the temperature at which liquid sulfur is in equilibrium with its vapour at normal atmospheric pressure. Have we any data as to the pressure likely to be found in Hell? The answer is "Yes". A nineteenth century mathematician has already provided the groundwork for us [3] and we may feel confident that by the year 2000 the total number of the damned will be at least 29,422,641,251,519,917,000 souls. Yet the area of the valley of Gehinnom [4] is only 7,000,000 square meters. We can now apply these figures in the Ideal Gas Equation to calculate what the pressure will be in the valley of Gehinnom. Since surely some souls must have been damned since 1877 [5], the pressure can only have increased since these calculations were made and the equilibrium point on the phase diagram of sulfur must have shifted still further, so that if we can show that at a temperature of 525C sulfur would still be liquid at the pressure calculated (which is a minimum value, remember), Hell (Gehinnom) is now cooler than Heaven. Certain corrections must be applied first, however. 1. Neiht based his calculation on a date of creation of 1658 + 2326 - 1877 = 2107 BC (minimum). Counting generations in the Bible gives a date for the Creation of 4004 BC. However, atomic dating has shown that Olduvai man is at least 2  106 years old [6]. 2. We should use a Fibonacci series for the expansion, not a simple doubling series. [7] The ancient Jewish laws against inbreeding also act in the same direction. [8] 3. By a fortunate coincidence, the effects of 1 and 2 cancel each other exactly. [9] 4. The human body is not an ideal gas, but 5. A good deal of it is gaseous at 525C, and in any case, 6. It could well be that at very great pressures the external pressure may well exceed the pressure of electromagnetic repulsion, when different "gas" laws would apply. This merely explains how the Lord works in fitting so large a number of damned souls into so small a space [10] and it need not be quantitative. In the calculation the following assumptions are made: 1. The average height can be taken as one meter. This seems a fair figure between the newborn babe and the fullgrown man. 2. The average space needed is about 30 cm  20 cm. It seems unlikely that any closer packing could be achieved. Neiht uses a figure of 1/20 cubic meters per person, which is nearly identical with my independent assessment. Mine allows a neat cancellation, later. 3. I have assumed that not more than two layers of damned persons can be accommodated, since otherwise those in the middle layers would escape the full rigours of Hell. So that, The volume available in Gehenna is 60  106  2 m3 and The original volume of the damned is 0.06  29.422641  1018m3 Then, at constant temperature (which we assume, taking equilibrium) P 1 V 1 = P 2 V 2 or P 2 = P 1 V 1 /V 2 Substituting, (1) P 2 = [29  6  1016] / [2  6  107] = 14.5  109 atmospheres = [29  6  10] / [2  6  10] = 14.5  10atmospheres Now let us see what pressure is needed to liquefy sulfur vapour at 525C. We have, using the Clausius-Cleypeyron equation in its integrated form, Log P = 7.43287 - 3268.2 / T where P = pressure in mm Hg and T = the elevated boiling point in K, so that Log P = 7.43287 - (3268.2/798) = 3.3373813 whence, (2) P = 2174.607 mm Hg = 2.86 atmospheres P = 2174.607 mm Hg = 2.86 atmospheres (1) is so much greater than (2) that Revelations 21 8 indicates a temperature very considerably higher than 525C. Thus, Hell is hotter than Heaven (which remains deucedly hot). REFERENCES 1.

A Mathematical Proof of the Non-Existence of Hell from the writings of the free-thinker Neiht, born in Brussels, 1877. "The area of the valley of Jehoshaphat is 60,000,000 sq. ms. ... Supposing that each race originated with one couple only, one has five couples or ten people, and applying to them the principle of compound interest, up to the Flood there were 9,289,000 births in 1,658 years. Since the Flood up to our epoch 2,326 years have passed, during which, if only five couples survived, they would have produced 2,213,867,610,000 children. If these calculations are extended up to the year 2000, the resulting number is 34,326,414,259,675,172,000 which, together with the 9,289,000, makes 34,326,414,259,684,461,000 offspring. If one concedes, charitably, that all papists are saved, their number today being 1/7th of the population of the earth, that of the damned would be made up of those born before the Flood plus those born since the Flood up to the year 2000 minus the 1/7th of those born since the year 44, that of the birth of Christ: this number is 4,903,773,008,164,544,000, and the total of damned would be 29,422,641,251,519,917,000. "The mean cubic area between a new-born infant and an adult is about 1/20th metre; the bulk of the damned above is equal to the mass of a sphere of radius 705,504 metres; that of the earth is 6,366,200 metres. "If one puts back the origin of man, following certain German naturalists, to 80,000 years, the number of damned would form a cube three times the size of the earth. "Now, how does one assemble the 34,326,414,260 millions risen on a surface of 60,000,000 sq. metres to judge them and how does one sink this mass of damned, through all manner of rock, to a depth of 5,660,660 metres?" [4] The valley of Jehoshaphat is the Gehenna of the Jews (Jehennam in the Koran)the place of eternal torment. The word is derived from Gehinnom = the valley of Hinnom where sacrifices were offered to Moloch (2 Corinthians 33 6) (= Adremmelechthe God of Sepharvaim). In later times, all manner of refuse was dumped there and fires were constantly maintained to consume it. The sulfurous stench and the fire was the original of the Christian concept of Hell.

This paper appeared in The Journal of Irreproducible Results, Vol 25, No.4:17-18 Copyright  1979 by The Journal of Irreproducible Results, Inc. IS HEAVEN EXOTHERMIC OR ENDOTHERMIC? I've received a number of requests to include one more scientific/theological parody using thermodynamics. This one showed up in a humor post to the newsgroup rec.humor in 1997. It has been "going around" ever since as a "true story" in several variants. But that's surely bogus. See snopes.com for a discussion. A true story. A thermodynamics professor had written a take home exam for his graduate students. It had one question: "Is hell exothermic or endothermic? Support your answer with a proof." Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law or some variant. One student, however, wrote the following: A true story. A thermodynamics professor had written a take home exam for his graduate students. It had one question: "Is hell exothermic or endothermic? Support your answer with a proof." Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law or some variant. One student, however, wrote the following: First, we postulate that if souls exist, then they must have some mass. If they do, then a mole of souls can also have a mass. So, at what rate are souls moving into hell and at what rate are souls leaving? I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for souls entering hell, lets look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people and all souls go to hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change in volume in hell. Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in hell to stay the same, the ratio of the mass of souls and volume needs to stay constant. So, if hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter hell, then the temperature and pressure in hell will increase until all hell breaks loose. Of course, if hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until hell freezes over. It was not revealed what grade the student got. Notes from snopes.com: Variations: Commonly, the piece will begin with a statement meant to authenticate the story. "An actual question given on University of Washington chemistry midterm," "from a Yale professor," and "Dr. Schambaugh, of the University of Oklahoma School of Chemical Engineering, Final Exam question for May of 1997" have so far been spotted. In some versions the student's comments culminate in the assertion that hell must be exothermic because a girl he'd been chasing had sworn it'd be a cold day in hell before she'd sleep with him, and he'd so far been unable to get to first base with her. Often the story concludes with "The student received the only 'A' given on the exam." Notes by D. E. S. These unattributed distributions with false claims of "a true story" are simply annoying, and also unfair to the original authors. The roots of this joke have been traced back to about 1920, to a piece written by Paul Darwin Foote in a house publication of the Taylor Instrument Company. If anyone knows of an earlier appearance, please let me know. Also, if anyone has the original version, I'd like to see it. I haven't yet seen the original version. This piece does not compare temperatures of Heaven and Hell. It begins with the "assumption that souls have mass". Mass is never an issue in the other two. It also assumes souls have volume. The "logic" is completely different in these various parodies. It seems to me far-fetched to connect the later parodies with the Foote parody. Nor am I convinced that Foote's piece "inspired" the others. I see no case that could be made for plagiarism. A good rule is "Whenever a story begins with 'This is a true story...' you can be sure it isn't so." I encountered a lot of this sort of thing when I was compiling a book of science humor, "Science Askew". People suggested to me innumerable anecdotes attributed to famous scientists and mathematicians, all purporting to be "true". The trouble was that the same stories were often attributed to different persons and from different places. I have come to assume that they are all inventions, or at least heavily embellished, unless some serious documentation is provided. The same is true for "quotes". The "If I have seen further than others..." quote widely attributed to Isaac Newton has been traced back to a Roman Poet Lucan (39-65 CE). So another rule is "If something is catchy enough to be attributed to someone famous, it really had its origin much earlier, probably with someone less famous." You can quote me on that. Finally, some readers quibbled about a misprint in the temperature of Hell that I had in the final line of the parody from Applied Optics, which I think is now corrected, though I still don't have access to the original printed copy. If anyone still doubts the result for the temperature of Hell, we suggest they apply the experimental method and go to the source carrying an accurate thermometer. But if anyone has access to the paper copy in Applied Optics I'd be happy to receive a scan of it. No one has (yet) faulted the calculation of the temperature of Heaven. Perhaps none are expecting to go there. * The cartoon, which was not associated with either of these documents, is by John C. Holden, from No Dinosaurs on the Ark by Sol Omon (Harris B. Stewart).

Last edited May 2014. <N> 1957: BBC fools the nation The BBC has received a mixed reaction to a spoof documentary broadcast this evening about spaghetti crops in Switzerland. The hoax Panorama programme, narrated by distinguished broadcaster Richard Dimbleby, featured a family from Ticino in Switzerland carrying out their annual spaghetti harvest. It showed women carefully plucking strands of spaghetti from a tree and laying them in the sun to dry. But some viewers failed to see the funny side of the broadcast and criticised the BBC for airing the item on what is supposed to be a serious factual programme. Others, however, were so intrigued they wanted to find out where they could purchase their very own spaghetti bush. Exotic delicacy Spaghetti is not a widely-eaten food in the UK and is considered by many as an exotic delicacy. Mr Dimbleby explained how each year the end of March is a very anxious time for Spaghetti harvesters all over Europe as severe frost can impair the flavour of the spaghetti. He also explained how each strand of spaghetti always grows to the same length thanks to years of hard work by generations of growers. This is believed to be one of the first times the medium of television has been used to stage an April Fools Day hoax. <N> Reindeer Facts and FAQ's This Page is still under Construction, please email suggestions to _EMAIL_ Basic Biology WHAT IS A REINDEER Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) are semi-domesticated caribou. Although similar, there are fundamental differences between reindeer and their wild cousins, caribou. Reindeer are shorter and stouter. Reindeer bulls are smaller than caribou bulls, but cows may weigh the same as caribou cows. Coloration differences may be too subtle to notice between many reindeer and caribou, however, reindeer tend to be lighter with occasional pinto or white haircoats. The nose bridge, or face, of reindeer are flatter than caribou. Reindeer tend to stay in more cohesive groups. When herded or chased they tend to run in a tight group, whereas, caribou are often scattered. These traits are the result of domestication. It is believed they have been domesticated in Eurasia for at least 7,000 years, which is longer than the horse (Edwards, 1994). In Eurasia reindeer are classified as either domesticated or wild. Only in North America are wild reindeer called caribou. CLASSIFICATION Kingdom-Animalia Phylum-Chordata (backbone w/ spinal chord) Class-Mammalia (milk producing) Subclass-Ungulata (hooved) Order-Artiodactyla (even-toed) SubOrder-Ruminantia (true ruminant) Family-Cervidae (deer) Genus-Rangifer Species-tarandus (w/ about five Holarctic subspecies) LIFE HISTORY Female reindeer typically reach reproductive maturity as yearlings and may stay productive up until 15 years of age. Some female calves on the Seward Peninsula conceive at five months of age and calve as yearlings. Bulls usually dont breed until theyre three years old. Their life expectancy is about eight years, usually ending as a result of their final breeding attempt. Breeding takes place in August and September with calving peaking around April 24th. This is a one month difference for breeding and calving between reindeer and caribou (and Scandinavian reindeer) Alaska Department of Fish and Game's Wildlife Notebook Series). However, reindeer and caribou can interbreed. Most likely, breeding would be between a male caribou and female reindeer, because caribou are usually dominant. ANTLERS Reindeer and caribou are the only deer (Cervidae) where males, females, and calves produce antlers. Substantial growth of calf and female antler can be obtained with good nutrition. Some females can grow small shovels (eye-guards), normally grown only by bulls. Like other deer, reindeer shed their antlers annually. Bulls drop their antlers by January, and pregnant cows and calves retain theirs until spring. Normally, pregnant cows retain their antlers a week or so after calving for advantage over food resources. New antler growth in the spring and summer is nourished by a highly vascular covering called velvet which is shed in August. Bull antler hardens (ossifies) in June and cow antler in July. The primary function of antler is for gaining social dominance. There is a demand in Asia (China, Korea) for antler just before it ossifies into hard bone.

The outer coat of long, hollow guard hairs are at a density of 5,000/ sq.in.. A fine wooly hair at 13,000/ sq.in. as an undercoat makes for an efficient air trap. This thick coat inhibits radiation and allows them to lay on snow without melting it and getting wet. Facial hair extends down to their lips protecting the muzzle when grazing in snow. Reindeer dont get frost build-up from their breath. Bone and cartilage in their nostrils are designed like a rolled-scroll. This increases the surface area inside so that blood can warm the cool incoming air. Heat is retained and moisture condensed and retained from expired air. The hollow guard hair provides bouyancy facilitating their swimming ability. Their multi-colored coat allows for concealment, an advantage for free-ranging reindeer. However, adaptations such as preventing radiation and lack of sweat glands for heat conservation in winter may cause stress in warm weather. In summer they shed their guard hair exposing their dark, soft undercoat. Feet Reindeer hoofs are large relative to their body. This load factor and wide splaying of their hoofs, acting like snowshoes, helps them to walk on snow. The hoofs are concave and do not have pads. The edges may act as blades and hair extending under the hoofs help when walking on ice. The shovel-like design also helps with swimming and digging for forage (cratering). Their hoofs and gait enable them to travel across tundra efficiently. They have a relatively high-stepping gait combined with a trot like a cross between a horse and camel. Because they are not as long-legged as caribou, it is thought that when reindeer mingle with caribou they have a higher predation rate because they may be slower than caribou. Feeding Reindeer, like all Cervids and Bovids, are ruminants. They are classified as a concentrate selector to intermediate forager which means they select higher quality forage, whereas, cattle and bison are considered generalist grazers because they eat large amounts of lower quality forage (Hofmann 1988). For instance, when given longstem hay, reindeer will eat only the more palatable leafy parts. Free-ranging reindeer search for emerging buds, leaves and flowers of sedges and dig for rhizomes in the spring, followed by willow leaves, forbs, and mushrooms as they emerge in early summer. Reindeer physiology is specialized to eat and digest lichen (sometimes called reindeer moss) as an energy source in winter. Lichen is produced by a symbiotic relationship between algae and fungi. (Click to see free-ranging Reindeer diet graph) Captive reindeer must be fed a balanced diet of commercial grains, forage and supplements. A special adaptation of northern ungulates is the seasonality in their appetite, metabolism and growth rates. Reindeer decrease their food intake and lose weight in the winter and increase their appetite and growth in spring and summer. This cycle is maintained not only for free-ranging reindeer, but also when offered ad-lib feed (shown in graph below). Also, they decrease their activity in winter to conserve reserves. Reindeer prefer snow over water in winter. The lack of minerals in snow and small amount in lichen minimize the requirement for water. Also, there is a lower loss of body heat to melt snow than to search for and warm copious amounts of water. Winter conditions may still exist when calves are born. Reindeer milk is extremely high in protein and fat. Many organs of reindeer are relatively larger than many domestic animals for increased growth rate. These two factors facilitate survival, especially for free-ranging reindeer. Adults, particularly cows, are nutritionaly stressed during springtime. They are known to eat rodents, eggs, placenta and chew on antler to attain limited nutrients. CURRENT RATION (18% crude protein Fish Meal and Barley base) Per Ton: Barley (rolled) = 1,544 Lbs. Brome hay (chopped) = 200 Fish Meal = 57 Molasses = 81 Corn oil = 30 Limestone = 16.6 DiCal = 5.0 Urea = 12.4 Vitamin Premix = 58 (Barley = 81.6; ADM-blue label vitamin/ mineral mix = 7.65; plain salt = 7.65; and corn oil = 4) Note: due to digestive dynamics with concentrate diets this ration should be offered slowly over a period of two weeks or more. Contact us for other diets and information. We supplement the diet with long-stem hay about every five days. This semi-fresh forage is something for our reindeer to nibble on to break the monotony of their concentrate ration, especially in winter. It may also help maintain a healthy population of microbes that produce enzymes to digest grasses. Remember, the leafy parts only are palatable to reindeer, and hay alone is not sufficient nutrition for reindeer. Weight Seward Peninsula, Alaska Birth- Females- 6.64 Kg 14.61 lbs.

Bulls generally shed their antlers in winter between December and January. Castrated males(steers) and non-pregnant females will shed their antlers between February and April. Pregnant females will retain their antlers until after they have their calves in late April and May.

Links Alaska Department of Fish and Game's Wildlife Notebook Series <N> General Description Santa's reindeer (R.t. saintnicolas magicalus) look very similar to common reindeer or caribou, but have many characteristics that distinguish them from the seven other common subspecies. In Europe, caribou are called reindeer, but in Alaska and Canada only the semi-domesticated form is called reindeer. All caribou and reindeer throughout the world are considered to be the same species, and, including Santa's reindeer (R.t. saintnicolas magicalus), there are 8 subspecies: barrenground (Rangifer tarandus granti), Svalbard (R.t platyrhynchus), European (R.t. tarandus), Finnish forest reindeer (R.t. fennicus), Greenland (R.t. groenlandicus), woodland (R.t. caribou) and Peary (R.t. pearyi). Alaska has mostly the barren-ground subspecies and one small herd of woodland caribou. Canada has three subspecies, the Peary, woodland and barren-ground. In most subspecies of reindeer/caribou, the largest bulls shed their antlers in late October, small bulls and non-pregnant cows shed theirs in April, and pregnant females usually retain their antlers until calves are born in late May. It is not known when or if Santa's reindeer shed their antlers. We do know, from a few furtive sightings, that their antlers appear extremely velvety and robust in late December. Santa's reindeer also possess the unique and remarkable ability to fly. A strenuous conditioning program developed by Mr. and Mrs. Claus enables them to travel great distances in a short time period, provided they receive frequent carrot snacks. For more information, including a copy of the Alaska's Wild Wonders kids magazine issue on Antlered Ungulates (and a page on caribou), visit the More Resources tab above. To see all the information in this profile on one page, click on the printer-friendly link above. Life History Growth and Reproduction Little is known about reproduction but it does appear that the life expectancy of Santa's reindeer is infinite. No deaths or fatalities have been reported, and none are expected in the foreseeable future, though stories are told of numerous "close calls" due to slippery rooftops and heavy jet traffic around major airports. Feeding Ecology Like other subspecies of caribou, Santa's reindeer eat the leaves of willows, sedges, flowering tundra plants, and mushrooms during the summer. They switch to lichens (reindeer moss), dried sedges (grass-like plants), and small shrubs (like blueberry) in September. An interesting question is how such foraging behavior is possible at the North Pole, an icy region in which plant life can't be said to prosper. But then again, Santa's house is not an ordinary place. The diet of Santa's reindeer during the month of December consists almost entirely of carrot snacks. This enables them to fly long distances, during short periods of time, in unfavorable visibility conditions. Migration Researchers differ over whether the annual night flight of R.t. saintnicolas magicalus may technically be considered a migration. Range and Habitat Santa's reindeer are reported to live at the North Pole, where they are cared for by Mr. Claus, Mrs. Claus, and a handful of specially trained elves. It must be very pleasant for Santa's reindeer in that land of ice, for throughout the short Arctic summer and long winter, Santa's reindeer rarely stray from their snowy home. One night of the year, however, observant children may detect traces of these elusive creatures anywhere human beings are known to dwell, from the busiest cities to the deepest jungles. The geographic range of R.t. saintnicolas magicalus may thus be considered larger than the range of any other member of the genus Rangifer. Alaska Caribou Herds North American Caribou Herds The movement of Santa's reindeer on Christmas eve is well documented. But what about their caribou cousins? These two animated maps show the movements of caribou herds over the course of a year. The map labeled North American herds shows four Alaska herds and eight Canadian herds. The map labeled Alaska Caribou herds shows the four northernmost herds (Teshekpuk, Western Arctic, Central Arctic and Porcupine) of the 31 caribou total herds in Alaska. The Porcupine herd ranges into western Canada. Note that the caribou bunch up or aggregate in June on the calving grounds. Caribou herds are counted shortly after these aggregations begin to occur, typically in early July. Data were collected from about 19902006. This project was done by CARMA  CircumArctic Rangifer Monitoring and Assessment Network. The Network is an international group of scientists, managers and community people who have a common interest in caribou. Status, Trends, and Threats Though there are very few Santa's reindeer, they are not listed as threatened or endangered. This is due to their unusual life expectancy, which is infinite. <N> A general view shows the earthquake-hit Beichuan county, about 160 km (99 miles) northeast of the epicenter of Wenchuan county, Sichuan province, May 13, 2008.

He was almost correct. The earliest coins are found mainly in the parts of modern Turkey that formed the ancient kingdom of Lydia, but are made from a naturally occurring mixture of gold and silver called electrum. These coins were first produced in the seventh century BC and had a design on one side only; the other was marked with simple punches. A Strict weight system Although irregular in size and shape, these early electrum coins were minted according to a strict weight-standard. The denominations ranged from one stater (weighing about 14.1 grams) down through half-staters, thirds, sixths, twelfths, 1/24ths and 1/48ths to 1/96th stater (about 0.15gm). It cannot have been easy to tell some of the smaller denominations apart. We must assume that for many transactions the coins were weighed rather than counted. The spread of electrum coinage From Lydia electrum coinage soon spread to the Greek cities of coastal Asia Minor. From there it reached the Greeks of the islands and the mainland. It is often difficult to tell where a particular coin was produced, because none of these early coins was inscribed with a place-name. Educated guesses are possible, however. One type of coin has the design of a seal on its obverse. The Greek for seal is 'phoce' and the coins are usually attributed to the Greek city of Phocaea. Names on electrum coins Some of the earliest Lydian electrum coins are inscribed with names in ancient Lydian script. Two individuals are known: Walwel and Kalil. It is unclear whether these are names of kings or just rich men who produced the earliest coins. The earliest legend in Greek on an electrum coin reads 'I am the badge of Phanes'. We cannot be certain who this Phanes was, but it seems that he was placing his badge on coins as a guarantee of their quality. The earliest coin hoard The earliest known hoard of electrum coins (and thus the earliest known coin hoard) was found during the British Museum excavations of the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus in 1904-5. The hoard consisted of 19 coins which had been placed in a small pot and buried alongside another 74 coins in the foundations of the temple, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, in about 600 BC.

Most Jews do not celebrate Christmas Most things are closed, so there is little to do on Christmas Chinese restaurants and movie theaters are often open Family get-togethers and work are other options Christmas is not a Jewish holiday. Many Christians think of Christmas as an American holiday, a secular holiday or a cultural holiday, but most Jews today do not think of Christmas that way. According to the 1990 National Jewish Population Survey, 82% of Jewish households never have a Christmas tree (and the idea of a "Chanukkah bush" is mostly a joke, not anything anybody takes seriously). A 2013 Pew survey found that less than a third of Jews have a Christmas tree, and most of those are intermarried. Even among those who are intermarried, only 71% had a Christmas tree, far less than the 92% of Americans who celebrate Christmas. A 2007 survey by InterfaithFamily.com found that only 37% of interfaith families that have decided to raise the children Jewish have a tree in the home. It has become a clich to talk about the "December Dilemma," the problems that Jewish parents face when their children become jealous of the presents and the fanfare of Christmas, or when interfaith couples must decide what to do for the December holidays. Many Jews (even highly assimilated Jews) are uncomfortable about Christmas. We don't mind other people celebrating Christmas. We aren't offended at a good-natured "Merry Christmas!" (although it may not give us the same warm-fuzzy feeling that you get). We don't mind the festive lights (although please, turn them off before midnight, I'm trying to sleep...). We don't object to the Christmas music playing 24/7 in every public place and many radio stations (although I find other things to listen to). And we're more than happy to share your cookies and candy (as long as it's kosher). Enjoy the holiday to your heart's content; just allow us to refrain if we choose to. We don't particularly want to celebrate it ourselves, and there is enormous social pressure to celebrate Christmas whether we want to or not. One Jewish writer said it's like being a man in the lingerie department: you feel like you don't belong there. Another Jewish writer said, "just try telling a Christmas enthusiast that the creche in front of your post office makes you uneasy; suddenly, 'frosty' describes more than just the snowman." Many secular Christians have told me that Christmas is my holiday too, and some of them get very angry or even nasty when I tell them that I don't want to celebrate it, calling me "Grinch" or "Scrooge." So if Jews don't celebrate Christmas, then what do we do on December 25? In some years, Christmas overlaps with Shabbat, in which case you can always go to synagogue! We shouldn't be doing anything on Shabbat anyway! Christmas overlapped with Shabbat in 2015 (Christmas night was a Friday night) and 2016 (Christmas Eve was a Saturday night). But they won't overlap again until 2020, and even when they do overlap, synagogue isn't an answer for everybody, because a lot of Jews don't observe Shabbat strictly. So what do we do? It's tough to find something to do on Christmas, because just about everything is closed. Here are a few of the more popular Jewish December 25 activities: Go out for Chinese food Many Jews go out for Chinese food on Christmas. In fact, Justice Elena Kagan mentioned this in her Supreme Court confirmation hearings: when a senator asked her where she was on Christmas, she said, "You know, like all Jews, I was probably at a Chinese restaurant." Someone even wrote a song about Jews eating Chinese Food On Christmas. The Chinese do not celebrate Christmas any more than we do, so most Chinese restaurants are open on Christmas. In Philadelphia and New York, there are several kosher-certified Chinese restaurants to choose from, so that even the most observant Jew can eat Chinese on Christmas. Go to the Matzah Ball In some cities, Jewish singles organizations sponsor "Matzah Balls," Jewish singles dances, on Christmas Eve or Christmas night. Go to a movie Many movie theaters are open on Christmas day, particularly in the afternoon (after 4PM). In fact, in 1998, a friend and I went to see The Prince of Egypt in a local theater on the afternoon of Christmas day (though I still haven't figured out why a Passover-themed movie was released at Chanukkah-time). Get together with family It's often tough to get the whole family together for dinner, especially when the children are grown up or not living in the immediate area. Christmas is a time when everybody is sure to have the day off. Some families do this do it with a vague sense of guilt at celebrating Christmas, and often repeatedly remind each other that "we're not celebrating Christmas, it's just a convenient time to have a family get-together." Go to work Jewish people often volunteer to work on Christmas, especially if they work in 24/7 community service jobs like hospitals, newspapers, or police departments. This allows their Christian co-workers to get the day off, and gives the Jewish worker an extra day off at some other time of the year, when everything isn't closed. Even if your business isn't 24/7, you can often talk your boss into letting you work Christmas in order to get another day off some other time. Some of my readers have told me about the following Christmas activities by Jews in their communities: A community in Mexico City organized a group of Jews to cover for Christians who would otherwise have to work on Christmas. This was called "Project Brotherhood." Jews in the New York, New Jersey and Philadelphia areas go to Atlantic City, where the casinos never close, and the hotels are very inexpensive. The casinos are practically empty on Christmas, except for Jews, Indians and Asians.

Written by Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil <N> The best skiers in the world came to the East coast of the United States and the fans of the sport came out in force. As one of the accredited media photographing the event, it was one of the greatest sporting experiences I have had. And I have had many. None of us knew what to expect when the AUDI FIS Ski World Cup made their decision to return to Vermont after a 40-year absence. The last time the world came to Vermont was 1978 when Stratton hosted an event. The last time they came to the East coast of America was Waterville Valley, New Hampshire, in 1991. Killington, known as the Beast of the East, spent over a month preparing the snow on Superstar to host the Womens Giant Slalom and Slalom on November 27th and 28th. The mountain delivered. But the East coast fans were there for hometown favorite Mikaela Shiffrin who finished a disappointing fifth overall in the Giant Slalom. With over 16,000 fans in attendance, the athletes were amazed at the volume of the crowd, hearing them cheer at the top of the race course in the starting gate. They had never experienced anything like it. And the World Cup officials have taken notice. My daughter was one of those fans. Both race days, she and her ski race team members arrived at the mountain at 6:30am to claim spaces at the finish line. Mikaela Shiffrin is the ultimate East Coast ski racer. Sundays Slalom event was Mikaelas chance to prove her dominance in the discipline. And she came through. My daughter has been ski racing in Massachusetts for most of her life, and Mikaela Shiffrin proved why she is the greatest athlete for young girls to emulate. READ MORE <N> pareidolia There is an universal tendency among mankind to conceive all beings like themselves, and to transfer to every object, those qualities, with which they are familiarly acquainted, and of which they are intimately conscious. We find human faces in the moon, armies in the clouds; and by a natural propensity, if not corrected by experience and reflection, ascribe malice or good- will to every thing, that hurts or pleases us. --David Hume* Pareidolia is a type of illusion or misperception involving a vague or obscure stimulus being perceived as something clear and distinct. For example, in the discolorations of a burnt tortilla one sees the face of Jesus. Or one sees the image of Mother Teresa or Ronald Reagan in a cinnamon bun or a man in the moon. Under ordinary circumstances, pareidolia provides a psychological explanation for many delusions based upon sense perception. For example, it explains many UFO sightings, as well as the hearing of sinister messages on records played backwards. Pareidolia explains Elvis, Bigfoot, and Loch Ness Monster sightings. It explains numerous religious apparitions and visions. And it explains why some people see a face or a building in a photograph of the Cydonia region of Mars. Under clinical circumstances, some psychologists encourage pareidolia as a means to understanding a patient, e.g., the Rorschach ink blot test. Astronomer Carl Sagan claimed that the human tendency to see faces in tortillas, clouds, cinnamon buns, and the like is an evolutionary trait. He writes: As soon as the infant can see, it recognizes faces, and we now know that this skill is hardwired in our brains. Those infants who a million years ago were unable to recognize a face smiled back less, were less likely to win the hearts of their parents, and less likely to prosper. These days, nearly every infant is quick to identify a human face, and to respond with a goony grin (Sagan 1995: 45). Sagan is right about the tendency to recognize faces, but I don't see any reason to think there is an evolutionary advantage in seeing replicas of paintings, ghosts, demons, and the like, in inanimate objects. There is, of course, an evolutionary advantage in seeing images of dinner or predators against a varied environmental background. There would be no advantage for, say, a hawk to be dive-bombing shadows on rocks, however. It seems likely that the modern mind is making associations with shapes, lines, shadows, and the like that are connected to current desires, interests, hopes, obsessions, and the like. Most people recognize illusions for what they are, but some become fixated on the reality of their perception and turn an illusion into a delusion. A little bit of critical thinking, however, should convince most reasonable people that a potato that looks like the Hindu god Ganesh, a cinnamon bun that looks like mother Teresa, or a burnt area on a tortilla that looks like Jesus are accidents and without significance. It is more likely that the Virgin Mary one sees in the reflection of a mirror or on the floor of an apartment complex or in the clouds has been generated from one's own imagination than that a person who has been dead for 2,000 years should manifest herself in such a mundane and useless fashion.

The stickers for this set had a 'movie reel' style border. Again there were 66 cards and 11 stickers. The most famous or infamous bit of trivia about this set was the accidental inclusion of an image some parents thought was obscene. No, really. It doesn't seem the sort of thing you associate with Star Wars, and maybe that's why the 'obscene' card is still famous even today. Various stories exist about how the image came to be included in the set, everything from an accidental trick of the light, to a deliberate prank by either a LucasFilm or a Topps employee. However it happened, it made card number 207 one of the most famous vintage Star Wars cards ever produced. Card number 207, as it was originally printed, appeared to give C-3P0 an added appendage that would not be particularly necessary for a droid. For this reason, the card is often referred to by collectors as the obscene version of the card. In reality, the added appendage (which might indeed be a trick of the light in the photograph) isn't terribly noticeable at first glance, and far from being obscene, is somewhat humorous in appearance. Parents of course were not amused, and as rumors about the existence of an 'obscene' Star Wars card circulated, complaints began to come in. Topps responded by reprinting card 207 for subsequent print lots. It is a myth that the obscene 207 is rare. It is not rare. The same number of 207 cards were printed as any other card in the initial print run. In other words, thousands and thousands of these cards were printed. The same is true of the corrected version of the card. Neither card is particularly hard to locate. It is true that the card is generally over priced when being sold. Most collectors want to own a copy of this unusual card, and generally they want to own both versions. For this reason, because demand for the card is artificially high, prices tend to range from $5-20 for this one card. Collectors should consider carefully what they are willing to pay for the card however, by keeping in mind it is not scarce.
