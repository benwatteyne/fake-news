Border Fence Firm Snared for Hiring Illegal Workers A fence-building company in Southern California agrees to pay nearly $5 million in fines for hiring illegal immigrants. Two executives from the company may also serve jail time. The Golden State Fence Company's work includes some of the border fence between San Diego and Mexico. After an immigration check in 1999 found undocumented workers on its payroll, Golden State promised to clean house. But when followup checks were made in 2004 and 2005, some of those same illegal workers were still on the job. In fact, U-S Attorney Carol Lam says as many as a third of the company's 750 workers may have been in the country illegally. Golden State Fence built millions of dollars' worth of fencing around homes, offices, and military bases. Its president and one of its Southern California managers will pay fines totaling $300,000. The government is also recommending jail time for Melvin Kay and Michael McLaughlin, probably about six months. It is exceptionally rare for those who employ illegal immigrants to face any kind of criminal prosecution, let alone jail time. Earlier this week, for example, immigration raids on six meat-packing plants netted almost 1,300 suspected illegal workers. But no charges were leveled against the company that runs the plants: Swift. Golden State Fence's attorney, Richard Hirsch, admits his client broke the law. But he says the case proves that construction companies need a guest-worker program. <N> A Southern California fence-building company and two executives pleaded guilty Thursday to knowingly hiring illegal immigrants and agreed to pay a combined penalty of $5 million. The executives could also go to prison. The penalty is one of the biggest fines ever imposed in an immigration case, and the case represents a rare instance in which prosecutors brought criminal charges over the hiring of illegal immigrants. Golden State Fence Co. will pay $4.7 million. Mel Kay, 64, the companys founder, chairman and president, will forfeit $200,000, and Michael McLaughlin, 42, a manager in the companys Oceanside office, will pay $100,000. The two men admitted hiring at least 10 illegal immigrants. People slip through the cracks and thats what happens. Mistakes were made, Richard Hirsch, an attorney for Golden State and Kay. Prosecutors allege the company hired more than 100 illegal immigrants from 1999 to 2005, and continued to employ dozens of undocumented workers even after two government audits. Hirsch said prosecutors plan to ask for six months behind bars for the two men at sentencing March 28. The maximum sentence is five years. Prison time is unusual in such cases. The company said in a statement that it pleaded guilty to bring this matter to a conclusion and restore normalcy to the business. The government has stepped up efforts to combat the hiring of illegal immigrants as the issue has grown in importance around the country. The plea bargain comes just days after federal authorities raided meat processing plants in six states as part of an investigation into the stealing and selling of identity documents so illegal immigrants could get jobs. Last year, in one of the biggest cases of its kind, Wal-Mart agreed to pay $11 million to end a federal investigation into the use of illegal immigrants at stores in 21 states. Companies, however, are rarely hit with criminal charges for hiring illegal immigrants. You have show a kind of criminal conspiracy, said Steven Camarota, research director of the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington, a group that advocates tighter immigration controls. The mere hiring of illegals is not enough. Government agents raided Golden State Fences Riverside office last year and found that 110 were unauthorized to work  including three the company had been ordered not to employ after a 1999 audit by the government. Golden State, which has 750 employees, saw sales soar from $60 million in 1998 to $150 million in 2004, according to a biography of Kay provided by the company. Among its projects: construction of part of a 14-mile border fence in San Diego in the late 1990s. <N> Readers are welcome to post comments on the material posted here, but some simple rules apply: No trolls allowed I reserve the right to refuse comments.

I suppose it was inevitable that the tidal wave of media flattery would recede from memory and allow the hollowness of his two terms in office to be perceived by those who dont think critically about what they see in the media. But now that President Trump is demonstrating the bankruptcy of the Obama administration economic and foreign policies with solid results that vividly contrast Obamas failures, a new poll has identified him as the worst president since World War II. To be sure, only a plurality, not a majority, identifies him as the worst. But give it a little more time, and let more facts come to the publics attention  for instance, the fact that he received emails from Hillarys private, unprotected email server that contained classified information. And this implicated him in a crime. And that he publicly denied knowing about the server from which he received emails. Its a long road ahead for the Obama reputation. <N> CLOSE President Trump says hes running again in 2020 but a new poll finds hell be behind in the polls regardless of who his Democratic opponent may be. Nathan Rousseau Smith has more. Buzz60 Who's the worst president of the United States since World War II? Donald Trump, according to a plurality of voters. A new Quinnipiac University National Poll released Wednesday showed that 41% of voters named Trump as the worst of the 13 presidents who have held office since then. He was then followed by Barack Obama, who received 21% of votes. Here's the rest of the breakdown: Richard Nixon, 10% Jimmy Carter, 8% George W. Bush, 6% Bill Clinton, 4% Lyndon B. Johnson, 2% Ronald Reagan, 2% Gerald Ford, 1% But while Obama came in second for worst president, he was also came in second for best president since that time, too. For his part, Trump came in fifth. Here's who voters thought was the best president since World War II: Ronald Reagan, 28% Barack Obama, 24% John F. Kennedy, 10% Bill Clinton, 10% Donald Trump, 7% Dwight D. Eisenhower, 4% Harry Truman, 3% Jimmy Carter, 3% Lyndon B. Johnson, 2% Richard Nixon, 1% George H. W. Bush, 1% George W. Bush, 1% The poll, which was conducted from March 3 to 5, also found that Trump's approval rating was at 38%. "In 73 years, 13 men have governed from behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office and none of them have done so with less admiration from the American people," poll assistant director Tim Malloy said in a statement. The poll surveyed 1,122 voters nationwide and has a margin error of 3.5 points.

Thank you and God bless! <N> Sun City-Peachtree, a retirement community in Griffin, Ga., has a strict one-flag per home policy, and it won't budge in the case of veteran Jim Lowe, who this week lost his campaign to fly both the Stars and Stripes and the Marine Corps colors outside his home. MyFox Atlanta reported Monday that Lowe and his wife now plan to leave Sun City-Peachtree to protest its intolerance. Lowe's other options were to remove one of the flags, or face a fine of $25 a day or a possible lien on their home. "When a bunch of arbitrary rules trump the Constitution, it is a sad date because indeed a piece of America is lost," Lowe said Monday, after the board of directors at Sun City-Peachtree handed down its final decision. Lowe's fight prompted community officials to put the issue to a vote, asking residents if they supported an official change to restrictions on the number of flags they were allowed to fly. The board said most didn't care enough to change the policy, so Lowe was asked again to remove one of the flags. "Who would want to stay in a place that tells you to what extent you can exercise your patriotism," Lowe told Fox. Retirement communities have attracted scrutiny for rigid regulations on flags on a number of occasions. Two separate incidents involving Georgian veterans and American flags have arisen just this month. In a retirement community in McDonough, Ga., officials attempted to force 92-year-old John Helton to take down his flag, citing a homeowners agreement. After a massive display of support and a vote by residents, community officials finally backed down. Days later, Armond "Sonny" Noah, a Korean War veteran living in DeKalb, Ga. complained that management at his federally subsidized housing facility had removed flags that he'd placed on community property. Officials with the complex said it was against their rules to allow flags to fly on public ground, but they apologized to Noah and said the matter was mishandled. <N> James Madison Lowe II of Sun City Peachtree in Griffin, Ga. passed away at home September 12, 2016. Jim was born July 26, 1940 in South Bend, Ind. to Jim and Ruth Lowe, who preceded him in death. He graduated from Notre Dame University in 1962 and immediately enlisted into the United States Marine Corp. He saw active duty in both Panama and Vietnam where Captain Lowe was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for his heroic achievement. After the military, Jim worked as a combustion engineer first in Detroit, then moving with his wife and 3 children to the Chicago area where his children were raised. Later, a job transfer took Jim and his wife Sandy to Peachtree City, Ga. where they lived for 20 years before moving to Sun City Peachtree in Griffin, Ga. Jim was a published author recounting his Marine service and time in Vietnam through A Jar Heads Journey and Last Letters. Jim is survived by Sandra his wife of 54 years, sister Patsy of San Diego, Calif., daughter Jennifer Lopez (husband Gil) of Mableton, Ga., son James Dasher Lowe III (wife Maria) of Naperville, Ill., and son R. Andrew Lowe (wife Kellye) of Madeira, Ohio. He is also survived by his six grandchildren Tara, Vince, Jake, Ava, Faith and Vivian. Jim will be cremated and laid to rest at Georgia National Cemetery. His family will schedule a military funeral honors ceremony at a later date. In lieu of flowers, memorials may be made to the Wounded Warrior Project (PO Box 758517 Topeka, Kan. 66675 or www.woundedwarriorproject.org who Jim supported through all profits from his book sales. Please join the family in honoring the life of Jim Lowe II by visiting www.conner-westburyfuneralhome.com and posting your tributes and memories. Conner-Westbury Funeral Home, 1891 W. McIntosh Rd., Griffin is in charge of the arrangements. <N> First and foremost, I refuse to engage in arguments about gun control.... or lend any credibility whatsoever to any arguments made by the same people who think laundry detergent is food. Bottom line here: When you are old enough to vote....when you ar e old enough to buy a gun, (at which point you will become familiar with the laws pertaining to them)....and when your ass gets a JOB and starts paying TAXES......THEN come talk to me and I might lend some credibility and veracity to your arguments. But until then, go eat some Tide Pods or crayons....or stand in the corner and spank your monkey. <N> At least five students were arrested Friday as hundreds of others from several Stockton high schools walked out of classes in protest of gun violence after last week's deadly shooting at a Florida high school. Advertisement Students at Stagg, Edison, Chavez, Lincoln and Village Oak high schools were walking along streets, creating traffic problems in the area as streets were blocked off. Stockton police said some students threw rocks and damaged both police and citizen vehicles. Five arrests were made, including charges of battery on an officer, resisting arrest, taking an officer's baton and vandalizing vehicles, including patrol vehicles, Stockton police said. Those arrested ranged from 14-years-old to 18-years-old. The 18-year-old was booked into the San Joaquin County Jail and the juveniles were cited to their parents, according to Stockton Police. During one incident, an officer approached a group of students attempting to leave a school by jumping a fence. When the officer approached the students, police said they fought with the officer and took his baton. Courtesy of Stockton Police Department The officer was patrolling an area of the high school while it was placed on lockdown. A person who saw the incident take place came to the officers aid until more officers arrived, police said. We do support the freedom to protest peacefully and freedom of speech, said Stockton Police Departments Public Information Officer Joe Silva. While the majority of the students were peaceful today, we dont condone the violence which was committed by a small handful of students. Its unacceptable to batter a police officer and especially to take an officers baton. Officials with the Stockton Unified School District released the following statement after the protest: "Stockton Unified is proud of the peaceful, well organized protests carried out by students on its high school campuses this week. We regret that on Friday some students from one of the high schools left a peaceful protest, walked off campus and created a disruption in the neighborhood. Such activity is not reflective of the values of the overwhelming majority of SUSD students and will not be tolerated." <N> STOCKTON  Thousands of Stockton high school students walked out of their classrooms Wednesday morning as part of the National School Walkout with a united message that they have had enough of gun violence and they expect to see the adults in charge make some changes. Each of the demonstrations at various high schools  Chavez, Edison, Franklin, Lincoln and Stagg  was organized by the students and was unique to each campus. But all appeared to be orderly, with no criminal activity reported to Stockton police and no one leaving campus to protest. Organizers such as Edison High seniors Gloria Alonso, 17, and Celin Corpuz, 18, were in their ethnic studies class when the topic of activism came up. They came to the conclusion that many of their peers are confused by all the rhetoric swirling around the earlier protests sparked by the Florida high school massacre. By organizing this action for students by students, we realize how important social movements are, Corpuz said. Together with junior Rogelio Vivero, 17, the three activists pulled together a crew of about 60 to 80 students to help them stage a demonstration and put on a program that made their message clear. In addition to student speakers, Edisons program included representatives from Cleveland School Remembers, an anti-violence organization formed in the aftermath of the 1989 school shooting at the central Stockton elementary school that left five children dead. Vivero believed the walkout at Edison made the message clear: I felt like a lot of students learned the issue about gun violence in our community, and I felt like right here in Stockton we should take more part in it because it happened here first. Cleveland Elementary was one of the first schools where a mass shooting happened. And a lot of my family here and friends feel like we should take part in this movement because it happened to us. Our generation is the generation to step up and finally voice our opinions, Vivero said. I hope students all across the nation understand that this is in our hands, this is our matter because of the 17 lives in Parkland. Those werent just any regular students, those were friends, those were our family. So here in high school or any school, we are all a big family and we should all watch out for each other. And thats the important message I think we conveyed today, he said. Edisons walkout began quietly with several dozen students standing quietly along an outdoor walkway leading to the school gymnasium while holding handmade signs with messages reading We Stand With Cleveland Elementary, Rise Up As 1, Edison Says No to Guns, Schools Not Prisons, No More Silence, End Gun Violence, Pull Laws Not Triggers, and We Rise With Marjory Stoneman Douglas. Their silence was broken by chants of Never Again, Keep Our Schools Safe, Hear Our Voice, and We Are Students, Not Targets, as most of the student body of about 2,000 left their classrooms and filed past. Once inside the gym, the large gathering appeared focused on what their fellow students had to say. Wearing a T-shirt with the words Know History, Know Self, Aizlrose Albon, 17, the student government director of multicultural affairs, opened the program: This rally is not so we can just get out of class. Our community has a lot of gun violence history and its been such a long time since the government has done something. Vivero provided the keynote address. I believe every student in the SUSD, every student in the nation should be able to walk into school and walk out without having the fear that their life is going to be taken away at school, he said to vigorous applause. Student Body President Alondra Manzo, 16, recalled the tragedy of Stocktons Cleveland Elementary School shooting of Jan. 17, 1989, in contrast with the Feb. 14, 2018, Florida school massacre. They happened 3,000 miles apart and 30 years apart. It could happen to anyone, anywhere. It could happen to us if we dont make change. Then the students got a firsthand history lesson from Cleveland Elementary shooting survivor Sue Rothman, a former teacher who held little back in describing the horrors of that day as bullets flew through her kindergarten classroom. Im angry and I dont understand, Rothman said, frustrated that with each subsequent school shooting a lot of words are exchanged but little to no progress is made in curbing the violence. Its time to make change in the United States of America. In uniting with the National Student Walkout, the students at Edison and other Stockton high schools are insisting that Congress legislate strong federal background checks for all firearm purchases; ban the sale of all military-style semiautomatic assault weapons; and ban the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines, according to a joint statement.

He was so adamant about pushing the cop-hating and white-hating mentality that was the catalyst in further dividing Americans, but now it seems to all have backfired. A conservative activist is in the process of holding Obama and his black extremist peers responsible for the hate that they have built through their idiotic persistence. Former prosecutor Larry Klayman is sick and tired of the cop-killing and extreme animosity towards police. He recently filed a lawsuit against a group of defendants that he believes are responsible for instigating the hateful crime spree. Some of the people named in the lawsuit are extremely well-known, and conservatives have been trying to hold these guys responsible for years. Former President Barack Obama, his former Attorney General Eric Holder, Al Sharpton, and Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam are all under attack in the lawsuit. His claim is that all of the men have  incited violence and in fact have a direct link to what happened in Dallas.  The lawsuit specifically claims that every single one of these men have violated law enforcement officers civil rights. They are also being charged with aiding and abetting murder, in addition to promoting terrorism. If these scumbags are found guilty they will be forced to pay a grand total of $2 billion in damages, which doesnt even begin to fix all of the damage they have done. Too many lives have been taken at the hands of Black Lives Matter members, and $2 billion doesnt replace even one of the lives taken from us. The issues going on today can be tracked back to the very beginning of Obamas presidency. He consistently forced the matter of racism in the United States, causing blacks to become extremely angry and wreak havoc all over the country. Klayman maintained that Obama and his allies worked extremely hard to challenge law enforcement, claiming police brutality whenever they could in order to inspire Black Lives Matter members to attack our men and women in blue. Obama actually went so far as to call police who responded to an incident that Henry Louis Gates Jr. was involved in stupid. He even met with the most violent anti-police leaders of the Black Lives Matter group. Barack Obama left us knowing for a fact that his loyalties lie with the most racist groups in America. The statement Klayman gave explains the lawsuit in detail: The defendantshave publicly incited people to violence with the fiction that police officers and other law enforcement are intentionally and systematically targeting and hunting blacks and other minorities to kill them for no reason other than racism or sport. Klaymans statement explains that all of the hate towards police in America is totally unfair and completely unjustified. There is no evidence supporting the claims that police have been actively targeting blacks. It seems as though the black community involved in all of the violence towards law enforcement is the real group of extreme racists. Klayman asserts that its not a big surprise that former Army reservist Micah Johnson actually expressed a craving to kill white law enforcement members after two highly-publicized deaths of blacks  at the hands  of the police. The lawsuit explains that the defendants have encouraged  immediate violence and severe bodily injury or death  multiple times to be brought upon law enforcement officers throughout the nation over the years. Defendants are encouraging disaffected blacks and black Muslims to ignore, disrespect and assault law enforcement officials, and commit violence and lethal force, the lawsuit states. Lets hope these bigots are finally held responsible for their sickening actions. <N> It felt like a watershed moment for a scattered and still-young civil rights movement. Inside Black Lives Matter, the national revulsion over videos of police officers shooting to death black men in Minnesota and Louisiana was undeniable proof that the groups message of outrage and demands for justice had finally broken through. Even the white governor of Minnesota, Mark Dayton, in a pained public concession, embraced the movements central argument. Would this have happened if those passengers  the driver and the passengers  were white? he asked. I dont think it wouldve. Then, in an instant, everything changed. Black Lives Matter now faces perhaps the biggest crisis in its short history: It is both scrambling to distance itself from an African-American sniper in Dallas who set out to murder white police officers and trying to rebut a chorus of detractors who blame the movement for inspiring his deadly attack. What I saw in Dallas was devastating to our work, said Jedidiah Brown, a Chicago pastor who has emerged as an outspoken Black Lives Matter activist over the past year. The moment he learned of the attack on the police, he said, he immediately sensed that any emerging national consensus would tear down the middle. The thing I vividly remember thinking was, this is going to show exactly how divided this conversation is, he said. For those who have harbored doubts or animosity toward Black Lives Matter  among them police unions and conservative leaders  the Dallas attacks are a cudgel that, fairly or not, they are eager to swing. <N> IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS DEMETRICK PENNIE a Natural Person and Resident of Texas, and Sergeant in the Dallas Police Department, on behalf of himself and other law enforcement officers deceased or alive similarly situated and LARRY KLAYMAN, a Natural Person and Resident of Florida, on behalf of himself and other law enforcement officers deceased or alive similarly situated Plaintiffs, v.

Klayman had found himself in a really low place: His client had just lost a sexual harassment case, which he blames on a judge he says had a grudge against him. Days before, he survived what he describes as a near-fatal car crash. ADVERTISEMENT As he drove through Los Angeles, he was talking to himself, saying: Larry, youre a revolutionary. Jesus was a revolutionary. Jesus told the high priests to go eff themselves, and then he told the Romans to go eff themselves. Suddenly, Klayman says, he felt a tremendous feeling of positivity and warmth. He recognized the feeling  Jesus had come to him in a Catholic church years before and encouraged him to become a Christian. This time, there was a different message. Larry, youre working for me now, Klayman says he was told in 2009. Youre not like me, obviously. And you will pay the price  but Im there with you. The story is a Klayman special  no hedging and plenty of righteousness. For years, the conservative lawyer has taken on long-shot cases predicated on obscure legal theories. With the exception of a since-vacated 2013 decision involving the National Security Agencys (NSA) collection of metadata, hes lost more than hes won. But his dogged championing of combustible conservative issues  and his tireless pursuit of the Clintons  has made him a bullhorn in Washington. His critics see him as a racist, a frivolous litigator and a conspiracy theorist. Klayman sees himself as a modern-day John Adams in a fight for justice. Ive intended to be the peoples Justice Department. Im not going to sit here and pound my chest and say Im the greatest thing thats ever lived. But I will stick my neck out for what I believe in, he said. And hes not going away. Klaymans mark on D.C. dates back to the Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonMontana governor raises profile ahead of potential 2020 bid Dem senator ties Kavanaugh confirmation vote to Trump-Putin controversy Don't place all your hopes  or fears  on a new Supreme Court justice MORE administration, when he founded the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch. He left the organization under acrimonious terms in the early aughts, but the groups methodology  harnessing the power of Freedom of Information Act requests  is credited with creating a new form of weaponized information inside the Beltway that persists today. A 2000 episode of The West Wing caricatured Klayman as Larry Claypool, a partisan litigator who ran an organization called Freedom Watch that stalked the presidents every move. Klayman cheerfully adopted the name for his current organization, formed after leaving Judicial Watch. In a slate of pro-bono cases across the country, which include a wrongful death suit against Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonBernie Sanders: Trump 'so tough' on child separations but not on Putin Anti-Trump protests outside White House continue into fifth night Opera singers perform outside White House during fourth day of protests MORE over the 2012 Benghazi terror attacks and a failed attempt to represent Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, Klayman continues his fight, though he recognizes that some causes have a better chance of success than others. But he bristles at the notion that any of them are frivolous. Im testing the limits of the law. Win or lose, I want to make a point, he said. You gather information along the way  even if you dont like the result, you get discovery. When Clinton appeared on track to become the first woman elected president, Klayman was prepared to ramp up the attack-dog role he has embodied since her husbands tenure. But with the victory of President Trump  who Klayman has said could prove greater than Reagan  the lawyer, who comes across as soft-spoken in person, has pushed a pair of task forces aimed at policing the media and the judicial branch. The so-called Leftist Media Strike Force targets the evil forces of the leftist media, vowing to use whatever legal means exist to eradicate their sleaze. A second strike force is geared toward resolving what Klayman sees as a crisis of judicial activists appointed to the bench by Bill Clinton or former President Obama by helping Trump select truly ethical and honest constitutionally minded judges who do not cook their decisions and actions to suit their political and other agendas. Those judges, Klayman says, have abandoned the American people. And that belief in a corrupt system is at the heart of Klaymans activism. I saw how big money had influenced my clients  and I took offense, he said. I believe in the justice system; I believe in people being treated equally. For his many detractors, Klaymans track record has promoted anything but equality. He has repeatedly advanced the false notion that Obama is not a natural-born U.S. citizen, filing an unsuccessful challenge to his placement on the primary ballot in 2012. In 2013, he convened a citizens grand jury to indict Obama for forging his birth certificate, among other allegations. In 2014, he sued the Obama administration for allowing the Ebola virus to enter the United States, supposedly to further terrorist interests against the Caucasian race and Jewish-Christian religion. Last year, he filed suit against Obama, former Attorney General Eric Holder Eric Himpton HolderHolder to sit down with Colbert amid 2020 speculation The Hill's Morning Report  Trump, Putin meet under cloud of Muellers Russia indictments Eric Holder: Calls to abolish ICE are 'a gift to Republicans' MORE, the founders of Black Lives Matter and others for inciting a race war that led to the Dallas police shootings. Perhaps his greatest success came in 2013, when a federal judge ruled that the NSA had exceeded its constitutional authority by gathering the phone records of Americans. An appeals court later vacated the decision, arguing that Klayman lacked standing because he could not show that his own records had been collected. But U.S. District Judge Richard Leon's original ruling remains one of the strongest rebukes of the program on the books. Following both the ruling and the bombshell disclosures of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, Congress passed of the USA Freedom Act, which curtailed the program. Klayman currently represents a computer technician named Dennis Montgomery who, after the 9/11 attacks, allegedly scammed the government into buying counterterrorism software that didnt exist. Klayman characterizes Montgomery as a whistleblower. Based on documents he claims his client has in his possession, Klayman believes that U.S. intelligence agencies have harvested the confidential information of more than a hundred judges and other prominent figures  including Klayman himself  potentially to be used for coercion. His myriad filings have led to no shortage of critics, including Republicans. During the NSA case, former George W. Bush official Brad Blakeman repeatedly referred to Klaymans delusions of grandeur, calling him despicable and a bully. Most of his cases never gain traction  and, in fact, he has been formally disciplined in multiple courts, including separate lifetime bans on practicing before two federal judges in California and New York. In a 2016 opinion, a federal court of appeals noted 12 cases in which Klaymans ability to practice law in an ethical and orderly manner was called into question. But Klayman, 65, appears impervious to criticism. He will happily point people to a 2013 argument on air with CNNs Don Lemon and The New Yorkers Jeffrey Toobin in which Toobin referred to Klaymans tin-foil hat paranoia about the NSA being after him and Lemon ultimately yanked Klayman off the air. Despite his many critics and his concerns with government surveillance, Klayman says he is not afraid  thanks to that visit in his car in the City of Angels. Thats why Im not scared. I dont worry about perceptions; I dont worry about what can happen  because I really feel like hes with me.  An earlier version of this story mischaracterized Klayman's state of mind in 2009.  Klayman's attempt to legally represent Bundy is ongoing.

Residents gathered last night for a vigil praying that 6-year-old Owen would pull through, but word came today he also died. Eddie Schmidt will now bury his wife and three children. Everybody is going to do everything possible to help get through this, so the scriptures tell us, said Pastor Ron Rock of Zion Lutheran Church. Charges are pending against the driver of the pickup truck that blew through a stop sign and slammed into the family's Subaru. There is a growing memorial at the crash site as the community expresses heartbreak and sadness. Lindsey's cousin says their family is asking for privacy while they try to get through this but they're thankful for the overwhelming support. L & H services specializes in heating, cooling and plumbing. The owners kids wanted to do something for the family. So they made a makeshift concession stand. Every dollar they earn is going to the Schmidt family. 10-year-old Caroline Hameister said, We started this before we even knew what happened. We just wanted to do it for fun. Then this came along and our heart dropped and we wanted to help their family. It's Beecher. It's a small town, it is what we do. Everybody's there for everybody, said L& H owner Mike Hameister. Funeral arrangements have not been made yet. Beecher residents are trying to raise money for the Schmidt family and donations can be dropped off at first Community Bank and Trust in Beecher and Peotone. <N> close Video Apple's most recent iOS update deletes Easter Easter and other major Christian and Jewish holidays have disappeared from Apple's iCal app for iPhone users running iOS 11.2.5. It's unclear if the missing Jewish holidays and lack of a Christian calendar are a software glitch or an oversight on Apple's part. Easter Sunday, which arrives on April 1 this year, is the culmination of Holy Week, commemorating the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the most important holiday in the Christian religion. However, it's absent from some Apple users' iCal calendars. There are other holidays on the U.S. calendar, such as Juneteenth (a holiday celebrating the abolition of slavery in Texas), Flag Day and Indigenous People's Day, that appear.

The tower video shows what unfolded in the moments before passengers scrambled to get off the plane.Terrified passengers slid away from American Airlines Flight 383 last October. Twenty passengers were injured, all of them evacuated in roughly two and a half minutes.The tower video provides a different view of what happened. There's a blast of smoke from the right wing as the Boeing 767 roars down the runway preparing for takeoff. Seconds later, an immense fireball appears, black smoke billowing from the airplane.Pilots aborted takeoff with just a few second to spare, stopping their plane on the runway.Firefighters were on the scene and attacking the blaze within minutes, surrounding the aircraft trying to suppress the flames and smoke soaring off the wing.The National Transportation Safety Board is still investigating the fire, but believes a turbine disk failed and pierced a fuel line.

He managed to get the multi national corporation to admit that their burger meat was sub-standard and have vowed to change it. Oliver highlighted how McDonalds used ammonium hydroxide to wash their beef before it was made into hamburgers, in order to make it fit for human consumption, without this stage the food would not have been legal to sell by nationwide standards. Meat that has not been treated in this way is usually used for dog and cat food. The ammonium hydroxide is used as an anti-microbial agent which basically acts as a catalyst to turn inedible meat into burgers. Oliver said: Basically, were taking a product that would be sold in the cheapest way for dogs, and after this process, is being given to human beings. Why would any sensible human being put meat filled with ammonia in the mouths of their children? Jamie Oliver has campaigned for years in the U.K for better food standards and to raise awareness for healthy food. In one demonstration to children he showed them the process involved making chicken nuggets, using questionable parts of the chicken like the skin and the internal organs. For years, fast food companies have gotten away with using sub-standard meat in their foods, but activists like Oliver are ringing in a change which means they no longer have anywhere to hide. The McDonalds website now states that their burgers do not contain the ammonium hydroxide-washed beef filler but have declined to say whether or not the change was brought in due to Olivers campaign. The meat washing process was never used in McDonalds in Latin America, the U.K or Ireland, only in U.S branches. There has been no explanation as to why this practice was carried out in some McDonalds branches and not others. U.S McDonalds customers have been understandably angered by the revelation, which suggests that some McDonalds franchises made the choice to make their products healthier for their customers while others chose the sub-standard version. Fast foods chains Burger King and Taco Bell both abandoned the ammonium hydroxide method of treating their meat far before McDonalds did, why did they wait so long? One of the scariest part of this story is that because the ammonium hydroxide step was considered by the USDA as a component in a production procedure there was no requirement to state it on the ingredients list.

As veteran journalist Philip Brasher reported over the holidays, the Iowa-based company that manufactures the beef product  at one time used in around 70 percent of American ground beef  has watched sales drop by 25 percent. Beef Products Inc. uses an innovative process to turn fatty beef trimmings, which used to go mainly into pet food and other byproducts, into hamburger filler. Because the trimmings are at risk for E. coli or Salmonella contamination, the company adds a mixture of ammonia and water (ammonium hydroxide) to kill bacteria. BPIs process, progressive food safety policies, and state-of-the art system have received numerous food safety awards and the company has never been linked to a foodborne illness. But when some consumers find out about the treated beef product  dubbed pink slime by a U.S. Department of Agriculture microbiologist  they dont like what they hear and food companies are taking notice. In 2008, many American eaters were introduced to the product by Food, Inc, the Oscar-nominated documentary, which portrayed the technology as merely masking a symptom of a bigger problem: the industrial meat system. A year later, a New York Times expose questioned whether the ammonium hydroxide process was really delivering on its food safety promise, which is especially critical considering the product is widely used in the National School Lunch Program. Last spring, chef and TV personality Jamie Oliver went a step further on his ABC reality show Food Revolution. He called the clever scientific process shocking and a breach of consumer trust. Oliver held up raw inedible trimmings fit only for pet food and put them in a washing machine with ammonia cleaning product to illustrate the BPI process. He also repeatedly called the product shit. (That was bleeped out.) The supporters of this product would say its safe and efficient, said Oliver to a live audience. But everything about this process, to me, is about no respect for food, or people, or children, and Id want to know when Im eating this stuff. And Id want it clearly labeled. Though Olivers show was discontinued last year due to poor ratings, when he blasted ammoniated beef more than 5 million people were watching, according to one estimate. The response on Twitter and the blogsphere was overwhelmingly negative. McDonalds and Burger King said their decision to drop BPI beef was not a reaction to the show. The decision to remove BPI products from the McDonalds system was not related to any particular event but rather to support our effort to align our global beef raw material standards, said Todd Bacon, the companys senior director for U.S. Quality Systems and Supply Chain Management, in a statement provided to Food Safety News. Burger King released a similar statement. The decision to remove BPI products from the BK system is not related to any particular event but rather part of the companys normal course of business, the company told the Argus Leader. Taco Bell declined a request for comment. Industry consultant and blogger Dr. Richard Raymond, former Under Secretary for Food Safety at USDA, blames Olivers show for the move to drop the product. This move, although not exactly described as such by the three fast food chains, was because of the ick factor as revealed by celebrity chef Jamie Oliver, said Raymond, in an email. I guess after the two prior attacks, the Oliver video must have been over the top, and it is scary that an activist can potentially take away one of our interventions that makes our food safer. That is not how food safety policy should be determined. David Theno, an industry consultant who is credited with revolutionizing Jack in the Boxs food safety program after the 1993 E. coli O157 outbreak, also believes the negative consumer perception of ammoniated beef is bad for food safety. Theno, who has advised BPI, said he understands why fast food companies are sensitive about their image. They dont want to have controversy around their brand names, he said. If you ask a technologist theyll say [ammoniated beef] is the right thing to do  a marketing guy will have a different slant on it. If you dont want bacteria in your food you have to treat it, he added. This is a good ingredient and a very effective intervention. Its almost like somethings been taken out of the arsenal that shouldnt have. And as a food safety guy, that bothers me. As many in the meat industry have pointed out, ammonium hydroxide is only one of many processing aids or safe and sustainable ingredients approved by the governments Food Safety and Inspection Service to reduce and eliminate pathogens on raw meat products. FSIS has a 52-page list of approved chemicals companies can use to treat raw meat, poultry, and egg products  many of them can be used without any labeling on the package because they are technically considered a process and not an ingredient. If consumers and restaurants are up in arms about the use of ammonia and can potentially drive a company out of business by their actions, I can only wonder what they are going to do when they look at the other chemicals in use to try and protect us from foodborne illnesses, chemicals like liquid chlorine and lactic acid just to name a couple, said Raymond. There are just certain unpleasant realities of how meat is processed in this country. Those of us with farm backgrounds maybe can accept them a little more readily than someone who has led a life sheltered from these realities. The tension between widely used food safety interventions and concern about chemicals in food will surely continue. Recent polling, sponsored by the food industry, suggests consumer confidence in food safety is slipping. At the same time, surveys reveal consumers consistently list chemical and pesticide use in food production as a top concern. All new food safety technologies must get through the ultimate filter  and that is consumer acceptance, notes Caroline Smith DeWaal, food safety director at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. Just like irradiation, a potentially life-saving technology to kill pathogens in meat can still face rejection by consumers, who are anxious to provide the best food for their families. The rise in demand for organic and local foods shows that consumers often go outside pure safety considerations to evaluating where and how the food was produced.

Sheriff Keith Merritt <N> On October 11, 2017 Jacob was admitted to the Barbara Bush Childrens Hospital for the last time. Jacobs Neuroblastoma has spread to his head- namely the sinuses, bottom of the skull, several spots in the small bones in the inner ear and several spots on the membrane between the skull and brain. We started radiation a week prior and Jacobs condition got worse and he was having no success with oral pain meds. On on the Monday the 10th we started chemotherapy in conjunction with the radiation and by Wednesday the doctors were concerned that there were no significant reduction of pain and decided to admit Jacob. Since then we have learned that his hip is extreamly peppered by tumors, which was described as looking like lace. This obviously has added to the pain and more importantly with his ability to walk and move around. With that being said, his father, Roger and myself have been told that we should be spending as much time as possible with him and we should start making arrangements for his passing. It is expected Jacob may pass away within the month. Today Roger and I went to start making prearrangements for Jacobs funeral, and were sticker shocked. No one thinks about having to do this type of planning for their child and because of that we did nor do not have life insurance on him. We are asking for some assistance from family and friends to help support this. We we understand everyone lives on a budget and if you can not donate the best way to help (other than prayers) is to pass this along on your Facebook or other social media. Jacob has touched the lives of so many, he as well his father and myself appreciate your continued support, love, and well wishes.

His obsessions include Minecraft and Legos, and hes a huge Star Wars fan. Hes also a photographer, singer and comedian, according to his stepmother, Tara Artinyan. And most of all, he really, really loves penguins. But Jacob has Stage 4 high-risk neuroblastoma, and doctors told his family in early October he probably only had a month to live. So theyll celebrate Christmas early this year, and Jacob wants people to celebrate with him by sending him cards, his mother, Michelle Simard told CNN. He got some cards from this Halloween, and he opened up and saw them and it was like getting a gift. He read it to us and had a big smile his face and his nose scrunched, Jacobs father, Roger Guay, told CNN in a phone interview. He was excited to see what people had to say and it just brightened his day. Fighting a long battle Jacob was diagnosed with high-risk neuroblastoma when he was 5. According to the American Cancer Society, only half of children diagnosed with the disease reach the five-year survival mark. After Jacob was admitted to the Barbara Bush Childrens Hospital on October 11, doctors discovered that the neuroblastoma had spread to his head and was incurable, according to a GoFundMe page set up by his mother. People have called him an old soul and I believe it because he has taught us so much about life and about people, said Guay. Hes accomplished everything that he needed to do by 9 years old, and a lot of people dont accomplish that, ever. An early Christmas Artinyan said the family decided to fast-forward Christmas to give Jacob one last celebration. And for him, that means a lot of snow, a decked-out tree, and of course, a real-life Santa Claus. But before his improvised Christmas celebration takes place in early November, Jacob asked for cards from anyone around the world who wanted to share his Christmas spirit. And only five days after he announced his wish, he has already received more than 100 cards from people all over the country  and even beyond. We got over a hundred, and theyre from all over the world. We have some from the Netherlands, from Australia, from Denmark, said Artinyan. Weve heard from all over the world at this point. Weve even heard from Antarctica. Antarctica  where Jacobs favorite animals live. Wed like people to live life like a penguin, and by that we mean dive into life, find warmth among friends, stay cool and just give to others, said Artinyan, referring to Jacobs favorite penguin poem, Advice from a Penguin.

He was diagnosed several years ago with Stage 4 neuroblastoma, a rare type of cancerous tumor that has spread to his head, including on the membrane between his skull and his brain, his family says. His mother, Michelle Thompson Simard, wrote on a GoFundMe page that Jacob has been admitted to the Barbara Bush Childrens Hospital in Portland, Me., for the last time. She wrote earlier this month that his father, Roger, and myself have been told that we should be spending as much time as possible with him and we should start making arrangements for his passing. She added: It is expected Jacob may pass away within the month. So the boys family, friends and complete strangers are bringing an early Christmas to the terminally ill boy  decorating his hospital room with a tree, requesting a special visit from Santa Claus and showing him support with homemade holiday cards that are pouring in from people all over, according to NBC affiliate WCSH. Jacob loves Christmas, his father, Roger Guay, told the news station, encouraging people to continue sending him cards. Any way to brighten his day would be a great benefit to him.

Since then we have learned that his hip is extreamly peppered by tumors, which was described as looking like lace. This obviously has added to the pain and more importantly with his ability to walk and move around, she wrote. Thompson Simard has been documenting the response from people who have been sending Christmas cards and toys to make the early holiday memorable for the boy. Last week, she posted a picture of Jacob with his first card, featuring a penguin, which his family says is his favorite animal. First Christmas card has been received!! Thank you Nolan! Posted by Michelle Thompson Simard on Wednesday, November 1, 2017 His mother told Good Housekeeping that his motto is live like a penguin, which, she said, her son believes means to be friendly, stand by each other, go the extra mile, jump into life and be cool. Jacob loves the holiday season, she said, and we want him to know that Christmas wishes come true and that there are good people who care all around the world. Since then, Jacob has been showered with presents. His mother posted pictures on social media, showing him with Christmas cards, games, toys and, of course, more penguins  including penguin socks. Jacobs mother said her child even received a video greeting from actor Rob Lowe and the cast of Code Black.

A sick toddler needed a liver  so her new nanny donated part of hers <N>  Jacob Thompson, the boy who got thousands of Christmas cards from charmed fans this fall, has died after a long battle with cancer. The 9-year-old was diagnosed with Stage 4 high-risk neuroblastoma, a brain cancer, in 2014. In October of this year, doctors told his parents that he only had a month or so to live. That meant he would probably miss Christmas. To make the most of the time he had left, his family celebrated Christmas early, and Jacob asked people to send him Christmas cards to help make his last holiday special. Oh, and how people responded -- thousands of cards, some featuring his favorite animal -- penguins -- made it to his bedside at the Maine Medical Center. He had some celebrity admirers, too, like Arnold Schwarzenegger, who made him a card, and members of the University of Maine hockey team and various local law enforcement organizations, who visited him in the hospital Read More <N> Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Update, November 20, 2017: Almost a month after his request for Christmas cards went viral, Jacob Thompson passed away from cancer on Sunday, November 19. The 9-year-old wanted to celebrate the holiday one last time, and tens of thousands of people helped make it happen. The boy from Saco, Maine, received literal pallets of mail, as well as visits from Santa Claus, the University of Maine hockey team, law enforcement members and perhaps most special of all, a group of penguins from the Mystic Aquarium. Jacob loved penguins more than anything, and went by the motto "live life like a penguin." His sweet request inspired people across the country, and lifted others too. During his last days, the Thompson family encouraged fans to spread the cheer by sending cards to military members instead.

It has spread to his head and hip, and treatment was deemed unsuccessful. Since Jacob is bed-ridden and has limited time left with his loved ones, they are bringing Christmas to him next weekend. On the big day, his room will transform into a winter wonderland  snow, sparkling tree and all (even Santa). But Jacob has one request: cards from anyone "inspired to reach out" to help bring the Christmas cheer. He has already started receiving cards. The first, from his friend, pictured a decked-out penguin (his favorite animal). According to Jacob's mother, Michelle Thompson Simard, "live like a penguin," is a motto of his.

Now comes word there is yet another reason to avoid getting your crafty supplies and holiday decorations from Hobby Lobby. They recently opened a new store in New Jersey and blogger Ken Berwitz discovered last week that Hobby Lobby doesn't sell any Hanukkah merchandise. Not a single menorah. Not a single dreidel. In the past few days two different friends told my wife they had gone into the new hobby lobby store in Marlboro, New Jersey and noticed that, although there already was a lot of Christmas merchandise available, there was none for the Jewish holiday of Chanukah (some people drop the "C" and spell it Hannukah. Same holiday). One of our friends entered the store, asked where the Chanukah goods were, was told there wouldn't be any, and asked why. According to her, the answer was: "We don't cater to you people" Understandably irate, she called the home office, and was told, indifferently, that hobby lobby doesn't have Chanukah on its list of holidays. Since I did not hear this ugly exchange with my own ears, I was not personally certain it was the case. And that's not good enough for this blog. So I just called the Marlboro hobby lobby and asked whether it would be stocking any Chanukah merchandise. I was told it would not. When I asked why, the answer - verbatim - was: "Because Mr. Green is the owner of the company, he's a Christian, and those are his values" FYI, I would guess that, in a five mile radius around the Marlboro store, a solid one-third of all residents are Jewish. But, then again, what is the difference? The reason hobby lobby won't sell Chanukah goods is unrelated to how many Jews are in the area, In a brief email to Patch, Hobby Lobby representative Vincent Parker said, "We currently do not carry any Hanukah items in our store. Our customers have brought this to our attention and we are currently evaluating our Holiday items and what we will carry in the future." Parker did not comment on the alleged remarks by a Hobby Lobby employee, and did not confirm the conversation ever happened. Over the weekend, backlash started to build and as of this morning, the company says: For what it's worth, I went to their Facebook page and asked whether they would confirm whether they do or do not sell any Hanukkah merchandise, and while my comment/question is still visible on the page, the ensuing conversation has been deleted. They seem to be responding to questions about a variety of friendly topics such as new store openings, discounts, etc., but questions from consumers about their policy on Hanukkah merchandise remain unanswered.All comments and questions regarding Hannukah merchandise are now being deleted from their Facebook page. EDIT: as Colorado Luis points out, they won at the tenth circuit and the Obama administration is now challenging. <N> OKLAHOMA CITY, October 3, 2013 - Hobby Lobby President Steve Green has issued the following statement on behalf of the company: We sincerely apologize for any employee comments that may have offended anyone, especially our Jewish customers and friends. Comments like these do not reflect the feelings of our family or Hobby Lobby. Our family has a deep respect for the Jewish faith and those who hold its traditions dear. We're proud contributors to Yad Vashem, as well as to other museums and synagogues in Israel and the United States. We are investigating this matter and absolutely do not tolerate discrimination at our company or our stores. We do not have any policies that discriminate; in fact, we have policies that specifically prohibit discrimination. We have previously carried merchandise in our stores related to Jewish holidays. We select the items we sell in our stores based on customer demand. We are working with our buyers to re-evaluate our holiday items and what we will carry in the future. <N> CLAIM Dunkin' Donuts is distributing online coupons for free boxes of donuts to celebrate their 68th anniversary. RATING ORIGIN In June 2018, social media users began sharing links that promised a free Dunkin Donuts dozen box in celebration of the chains 68th anniversary, in return for the completion of a short survey: However, those widely-shared links were merely a version of a common online scam. Some people with virus protection who attempted to complete the survey reported encountering malware warnings shortly after clicking the link: Dunkin DonutsUS , there is a coupon going around on Facebook for FREE dozen donuts, when you click it you are routed to a survey of 3 questions, then you are asked to share it on facebook, then you are asked to message it to 15 people final step you are redirected to another site at which point my WEBROOT SECURITY ALERTED Me DANGER THE PAGE YOU ARE ATTEMPING TO ACCESS HAS MALWARE are you sure you want to continue. I did not continue and warned everyone I sent it to not to enter and request the coupon. Is this a fake offer that you should be warning your followers about? Moreover, even those users who experienced no malware issues still had to like and share and link to the scam, and disclose personal information, to qualify for their supposedly free donuts. A representative for Dunkin Donuts wrote on the companys official Facebook page that the online free dozen coupon is not one offered by the chain: There are many Facebook coupon scams operating in the same manner, and the problem has been present for years. In 2014, the Better Business Bureau issued guidelines warning specifically of identical scams on Facebook targeting shoppers: <N> UPDATE: A Dunkin Donuts media relations spokesperson provided the following statement to EducationWorld: "A Dunkin' Donuts restaurant in Minooka, Illinois posted an offer on Facebook for a free medium hot or iced coffee for teachers every Monday in the month of September, exclusively for that restaurant. While this offer was intended to be targeted to the restaurant's local community only, it has caused guest confusion outside of the Minooka area. The image has since been removed to avoid causing further confusion." An Illinois Dunkin Donuts promotion is circulating around Facebook and elsewhere stating that the popular coffee chain is giving away free coffee to teachers (with ID) every Monday in September. The post is causing confusion in social media outlets and EducationWorld would like to quash the rumors that the deep discount is available nationwide. The ad reads, "Teacher Appreciation: Every Monday in September, teachers start out their week with a free medium hot or iced coffee from Dunkin Donuts! Just show your ID!" According to popular coupon blogger Gina Juliano of GinasKokopelli.com, Dunkin's corporate office confirmed that the offer was a local promotion only. Teachers were further advised to check with their area stores before getting their heart set on the freebie. Juliano's site has a copy of the image customers are salivating over. The prospect of free coffee, as well as other promotional items, drew interest from teachers all over the country. One Facebook group, "Free Coffee for Teachers," aims to persuade coffee chains--such as Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, and McDonalds--to offer free coffee each day to all K-12 teachers. A contact from Dunkin Donuts' corporate office in Canton, Mass. was not available for comment by press time on how many customers contacted them about the September "teacher appreciation" promotion or whether or not they regularly offer promotions to educators. The Dunkin corporate Facebook page stated to several customers in posts that the image comes from a Minooka, Ill. promotion.

Both fast food chains have kicked off the new year with promotions giving away free coffee on Mondays. Theyre limited-time offers, and the deal isnt available in all markets, but in the case of many McDonalds locations, customers can expect free coffee every single Monday throughout the entirety of 2015. For instance, McDonalds restaurants in the greater Washington, D.C., region, which includes parts of Virginia, Maryland, and West Virginia, are giving away one free small coffee per customerhot or iced, no purchase required, even for drive-thru visitson every Monday this year. A spokesperson for McDonalds told us the company is aware of locations in the following areas that are giving away free coffee on Mondays: Washington, D.C. Johnstown-Altoona, Pennsylvania Norfolk-Portsmouth-Newport News, Virginia Indianapolis/Lafayette, Indiana South Bend/Ft. Wayne, Indiana Cincinnati, Ohio Austin, Texas Each region determines the particulars of its coffee giveaway, and not all are making the promotion available for a full 12 months. In central Indiana, for instance, free coffee Mondays extend only through June 1. And why isnt the free coffee promotion available nationwide, like McDonalds did for two-week stints a couple of times in 2014? Apparently McDonalds in many parts of the country feel like its not in their best interests to give away coffee. The markets determine what is best for their customers and customize their offers accordingly, the McDonalds spokesperson explained. Likewise, Dunkin Donuts appears to be strategically limiting its coffee giveaway to areas where business could use a bump locallyspecifically, the Midwest. Understandably, customers in the Northeast, where DD blankets the landscape, are out of luck and must continue paying for their coffee. A representative for Dunkin Donuts confirmed that, among other locations, DDs in the following cities are giving away one free coffee per customer on Mondays, through January 19 only: Cedar Rapids, Iowa Des Moines, Iowa Topeka, Kansas Wichita, Kansas Rochester, Minnesota Kansas City, Missouri Lincoln, Nebraska Omaha, Nebraska Green Bay, Wisconsin Madison, Wisconsin Milwaukee, Wisconsin <N> To commemorate the first day of spring (in the northern hemisphere), participating outlets of the Dunkin Donuts coffee and baked goods chain throughout the U.S. will be giving way free iced coffee drinks on 21 March 2007. All throughout that day, customers who visit any Dunkin Donuts restaurant in the U.S. can receive a free 16 oz. cup of Dunkin Donuts premium iced coffee, double-brewed to ensure full flavor with every cup. According to Dunkin Donuts press release: We look forward to treating everyone to a free cup of our delicious, freshly brewed iced coffee to celebrate the arrival of spring, said Robert Rodriguez, Dunkin Donuts brand president. As the category leader, Dunkin Donuts has been brewing iced coffee for more than 25 years and we are thrilled to be kicking off another iced coffee season with this all day, nationwide event. Iced coffee is fast becoming as hot as the classic cup at Dunkin Donuts. While iced coffee sales typically spike in summer months, Dunkin Donuts has seen rapid growth year-round, including during the winter months. Iced coffee is the second most frequently sold product after hot coffee at Dunkin Donuts. According to NPD CREST data, Americans drank more than 450 million servings of iced coffee in restaurants in 2006  a 16 percent increase from 2005  and Dunkin Donuts sold more than 150 million servings of iced coffee last year. <N> Social justice warriors are never satisfied.

After demanding that southern states take down statues of Confederate figures, the activist Left is now targeting an iconic American president featured on Mount Rushmore. On Monday, more than 200 SJW zealots held a protest inside the American Museum of Natural History in New York City to take down the supposedly racist statue of former President Theodore Roosevelt.

The entire spectacle was underscored by a sort of religious fanaticism. In fact, the devout left-wing activists moved from exhibit to exhibit in a trance-like motion burning sage and exuberantly playing Native American music.

More than 200 people cheered outside the museum as activists covered the statue of Roosevelt on horseback flanked by an African American and Native American on either side and demanded it be ultimately removed.

The statue is seen as an affront to all who pass it on entering the museum, but especially to African and Native Americans. Activists from the groups NYC Stands with Standing Rock and Decolonize This Place organized the protest to draw attention to the museums encouragement of racist tropes, and implored New York City to rename Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples Day. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Anti-Columbus Day protest Columbus Day controversially commemorates Christopher Columbus reportedly arriving in the Americas on 12 October 1492. Columbus is believed to have brutally enslaved the indigenous people upon his arrival and imposed harsh punishments, including torture. His arrival also ushered in European settlers to the Americas who waged wars against Native Americans and brought diseases with them that had a lasting devastating effect. There is growing movement to change the name of Columbus Day. In the past year cities in 10 different states have moved to change the name to Indigenous Peoples Day, the largest being in Phoenix, Arizona. However, opposition remains in places like Oklahoma City, and Cincinnati. In New York, the Columbus Day Parade attracted 35,000 marchers and many more viewers. Its considered a celebration of Italian heritage given Columbus was born near Genoa. This is Indigenous Peoples Day, said Kandia Crazy Horse, a country singer who is a member of the Pamunkey tribe of Virginia. In celebrating this, were trying to see that New York City and the rest of Turtle Island [North America] ratifies Indigenous Peoples Day as an  annual event thats counter to the Christopher Columbus narrative and Columbus Day. Amin Husain, an artist and organizer with Decolonize This Place, said they had been working on Mondays protest for about three weeks. He said it was important to debunk what was being shown in the museum. This is the most coveted museum, said Husain. I think that people are ignorant. Its a white supremacist society. It doesnt seem like its important [renaming the day] but it is super important for oppressed people. The group started with a 10-stop tour of the museum in which they highlighted a variety of exhibits they felt were racist and misrepresentative, which ranged from how the representation of Africans reinforces negative stereotypes to the exoticizing of Islam in the Hall of Islam exhibit. Where is the Hall of Christendom? one of the tour guides asked. Its just to echo what this is, its really a hall of white supremacy, thats what this is, said Nitasha Dhillon, one of the organizers.

Teddy Roosevelts nature was not empty wilderness. It was and is indigenous land, one reader said as the organizers took turns reading from a speech. Taken through violence. Just like Columbus who came to enslave. To take their gold and their bodies and their souls. Musicians played songs from the Lenape tribe, whose territory the city sits on, and activists walked through the crowd with burning sage. Outside about 25 police officers arrived as the group attempted to shield Roosevelts statue with a green material, but there were no arrests. <N> Ready to join the resistance?

On a day traditionally devoted to memorializing imperialist poster child Christopher Columbus, a crew of cultural renegades crashed the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan with an alternative Indigenous Peoples Day celebration. The artist-activist collective Decolonize This Place occupied the vaunted institution withwhat elsean educational tour. Ad Policy The crowd of about 200 mostly youthful observers embarked on a subversive walk-through, snaking around displays of native artifacts poached from different continents, gazing at the scenes of primitive societies in a new light as their radical tour guides gave their own explanations of the exhibits. Their route was mapped out on a red-and-white printed brochure, with a cover depicting the Theodore Roosevelt statue at the museums entrance surrounded by police barricades. At the Hall of Asian Mammals, standing amid a macabre menagerie of decorated carcasses, Tongan artist Vaimoana Litia Makakaufaki Niumeitolu proclaimed, Shot down, stuffed, and hauled to the museum for display, these species made their way here through the circuits of empire. Rooted in colonial plunder, she explained, the project that began with the embalmed animals continues today with the ongoing expropriation of native land throughout the world for conservation, with wildlife preserves that have been depopulated for the use of tourists, just as the tradition of indigenous resistance continues. The tour proceeded to examine the antiquated orientalism of the Hall of Islam, which depicted the Muslim world as a primitive anti-modern cultural sphere; exposed the eugenicist ideology underpinning the Mans Rise to Civilization exhibit, which placed Western modernity and technology at the pinnacle of social development; and dissected the Hall of African Peoples, in which black bodies are displayed as specimens and the vast multiplicity of African social and cultural life is thinned out and labeled like flora and fauna. The collective behind the alternative tour, Decolonize This Place, grew out of the academic and artistic collaborations that began percolating during Occupy Wall Street five years ago. Their museum takeover was a symbolic protest against the gentrification and displacement unfolding just outside the marble walls, in poor communities of color of the surrounding city that are excluded from such elite cultural spheres. <N> UPPER WEST SIDE, NY  Protesters covered a statue depicting President Theodore Roosevelt on horseback flanked by caricatures of Native American and African American men during an anti-Columbus Day rally Monday. The statue, located at the Central Park entrance of the American Museum of Natural History, represents "A stark embodiment of the white supremacy that Roosevelt himself espoused and promoted," protesters wrote in an open letter to Mayor Bill de Blasio. The covering of the Roosevelt statue was part of a larger Anti-Columbus Day Tour of the Natural History Museum organized by activist group Decolonize This Place. "New York's premier scientific museum continues to honor the bogus racial classification that assigned colonized peoples to the domain of Nature and the colonizers to the realm of Culture," reads Decolonize This Place's open letter. During the tour, protesters walked through the museum from about 4 p.m. to 5 p.m., Decolonize This Place organizer Amin Husain told Patch. During the tour of the museum, Husain said he noticed an increased security presence, but that even some security guards took pamphlets and seemed engaged in the tour. It wasn't until after 5 p.m. that 200 to 300 protesters circled the statue and used long poles to drape the tarp over the front of the statue.

The statue is city-owned and on land owned by the Parks Department, so the city would have jurisdiction. Husain told Patch that the city has not given any indication they are looking to take the statue down. As long as the statue, and other symbols of white supremacy stands, protests will become a more regular occurrence, Husain said. "The days that let white supremacy and racism that would go unchecked in our institutions are over," Husain told Patch. "There's going to be a more concerted effort, including these types of actions to up the ante until people get what they want, which is not to have these types of statues and not to have a Columbus Day, not to celebrate a murderer." A message left with a spokesman from the American Museum of Natural History has not been returned. Photo: Courtesy of Twitter user Sean M. Kennedy <N> Open Letter on Indigenous Peoples Day, 2016 To: Mayor de Blasio, New York City Council, and the Trustees of the American Museum of Natural History Decolonize This Day Many American cities have bowed to the obvious and renamed Columbus Day as Indigenous Peoples Day. Why is New York not among them? There is no reason for holding out any longer. Its time for the Mayor and City Council to stand on the right side of history. New York City sits on the territory of the Lenape, and over one hundred thousand Indigenous people live on this territory todaymore than any other city in the United States! Lets honor the rich legacy and achievements of Native Americans and discard the unsavory celebration of imperial conquest. This public holiday must be relaunched as an occasion to dignify our Indigenous brothers and sisters, it should no longer commemorate a figure widely associated with exploitation and enslavement. Decolonize This Statue The equestrian status of Theodore Roosevelt on Central Park West outside the American Museum of Natural History has often been cited as the most hated monument in New York City. Its easy to see why. A stark embodiment of the white supremacy that Roosevelt himself espoused and promoted, the statue is an affront to all who pass it on entering the museum, but especially to African and Native Americans. Statuary is not forever, and a monument that appears to glorify racial hierarchies should be retired from public view. The international movement that began with the dismantling of Cecil Rhodes statue at the University of Cape Town, and escalated in this country with the removal of Confederate flags and generals from public display, has come to New York. The statue is city-owned, and it sits on Parks Department land. City Council members should all agreeits time to take Teddy down. Decolonize This Museum Why are indigenous cultural artifacts still in the American Museum of Natural History, while their Greek and Roman counterparts are housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art across the park? Because New Yorks premier scientific museum continues to honor the bogus racial classification that assigned colonized peoples to the domain of Nature and the colonizers to the realm of Culture. Its time to accept that The Hall of African Peoples does not belong in the same exhibition framework as The Akeley Hall of African Mammals, or that Indigenous cultures need to be presented in ways that are distinct from the display of fossils and meteorites. These arrangements should be reviewed and reconceived by representatives of the exhibited populations. Human remains, sacred things, and objects of power stolen from Indigenous peoples should be placed under the authority of the descendants. The American Museum of Natural History has long been an embarrassment to New Yorkers. It needs a serious renovation, to be undertaken by a diverse range of curators drawn from the populations featured in the museum.

He is the author of the forthcoming book, "Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook." Antifascists may seem like a novelty, but theyve been around for a very long time. Maybe we should start listening to them. (Getty Images) On Monday, President Trump capitulated to the popular demand that he distance himself from his comment that many sides were to blame in Charlottesville by explicitly denouncing white nationalism. Racism is evil, he appeared to grudgingly concede, including the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists. A day later, however, Trump reversed course by clarifying that there were very fine people at the white power rally, while casting blame on both sides including the allegedly alt-left antifa. First bursting into the headlines when they shut down far-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos in February at the University of California at Berkeley, antifascists again captivated the public imagination by battling the fascists assembled at the Unite the Right white power rally in Charlottesville. But what is antifa? Where did it come from? Militant anti-fascist or antifa (pronounced ANtifa) is a radical pan-leftist politics of social revolution applied to fighting the far right. Its adherents are predominantly communists, socialists and anarchists who reject turning to the police or the state to halt the advance of white supremacy. Instead they advocate popular opposition to fascism as we witnessed in Charlottesville. [Heather Heyer is part of a long tradition of white anti-racism activists] There are antifa groups around the world, but antifa is not itself an interconnected organization, any more than an ideology like socialism or a tactic like the picket line is a specific group. Antifa are autonomous anti-racist groups that monitor and track the activities of local neo-Nazis. They expose them to their neighbors and employers, they conduct public education campaigns, they support migrants and refugees and they pressure venues to cancel white power events. The vast majority of anti-fascist organizing is nonviolent. But their willingness to physically defend themselves and others from white supremacist violence and preemptively shut down fascist organizing efforts before they turn deadly distinguishes them from liberal anti-racists. Antifascists argue that after the horrors of chattel slavery and the Holocaust, physical violence against white supremacists is both ethically justifiable and strategically effective. We should not, they argue, abstractly assess the ethical status of violence in the absence of the values and context behind it. Instead, they put forth an ethically consistent, historically informed argument for fighting Nazis before its too late. As Cornel West explained after surviving neo-Nazi attacks in Charlottesville, If it hadnt been for the antifascists protecting us from the neo-fascists, we would have been crushed like cockroaches. Though antifa are often treated as a new force in American politics since the rise of Trump, the anti-fascist tradition stretches back a century. The first antifascists fought Benito Mussolinis Blackshirts in the Italian countryside, exchanged fire with Adolf Hitlers Brownshirts in the taverns and alleyways of Munich and defended Madrid from Francisco Francos insurgent nationalist army. Beyond Europe, anti-fascism became a model of resistance for the Chinese against Japanese imperialism during World War II and resistance to Latin American dictatorships. A World War II anti-fascism propaganda film found a new audience after the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. on Saturday, Aug. 12. (The Washington Post) Modern antifa politics can be traced to resistance to waves of xenophobia and the emergence of white power skinhead culture in Britain in the 1970s and 80s. It also has its roots in self-defense groups organized by revolutionaries and migrants in Germany, as the fall of the Berlin Wall unleashed a violent neo-Nazi backlash. In the United States and Canada, activists of the Anti-Racist Action Network (ARA) doggedly pursued Klansmen, neo-Nazis and other assorted white supremacists from the late 1980s into the 2000s. Their motto was simple but bold: We go where they go. If Nazi skinheads handed out leaflets at a punk show in Indiana about how Hitler was right, ARA was there to show them the door. If fascists plastered downtown Albertas Edmonton with racist posters, ARA tore them down and replaced them with anti-racist slogans. Responding to small fascist groups may seem trivial to some, but the rise of Hitler and Mussolini show that resistance is not a light switch that can simply be flipped on in a crisis. Once the Nazi and fascist parties gained control of government, it was too late to pull the emergency brake. In retrospect, antifascists have concluded, it would have been much easier to stop Mussolini back in 1919 when his first fascist nucleus had 100 men. Or to stamp out the far-right German Workers Party, which had only 54 members when Hitler attended his first meeting, before he transformed it into the National Socialist German Workers Party (the Nazi Party). Though the regimes that inspired their original protests are long dead, antifascists have devoted themselves to treating small fascist and Nazi groups as if they could be the nucleus of a murderous movement or regime of the future. [President Trumps America First slogan was popularized by Nazi sympathizers] For years, antifascists have been maligned for treating groups of 40 or 60 Klansmen or fascists with the utmost seriousness. Members of the 10-year-old Rose City Antifa of Portland, Ore., the countrys oldest currently existing antifa group, confronted criticism even from the left for devoting themselves to unmasking and exposing the activities of small groups of local racists, Islamophobes and fascists rather than focusing on more large-scale, systemic injustices. Years before the alt-right even had a name, antifascists were spending thankless hours scouring seedy message boards and researching clandestine neo-Nazi gatherings. They were tracking those who planted the seeds of the death that we all witnessed in Charlottesville. Agree or disagree with their methods, the antifa, who devote themselves to combating racism, are in no way equivalent to alt-right trolls who joke about gas chambers. Behind the masks, antifa are nurses, teachers, neighbors, and relatives of all races and genders who do not hesitate to put themselves on the line to shut down fascism by any means necessary. It should not have taken the murder of Heather Heyer for so many of us, especially white people, to take seriously the threat of white power that has plagued communities of color for generations. The history of anti-fascist demands that we take seriously the violence of white supremacists. The days of just ignoring them are over. Black bloc tactics are used by "antifascist action" or "antifa" protesters. Here's what that means.

The whole point of Confederate monuments is to celebrate white supremacy White supremacists didnt just arrive in Charlottesville. Theyve always been there. <N> Jessica Lehrman for the Village Voice Several hundred activists draped a parachute over a statue of Teddy Roosevelt outside the American Museum of Natural History yesterday afternoon to protest the statues white supremacist iconography and the racist, 19th-century attitudes that still pervade the museum behind it. The 10-foot tall 1939 statue depicts Teddy Roosevelt, heroic astride a horse, loyally flanked on one side by an indigenous man in a feathered head-dress and on the other by an African man. This statue is all about hierarchy and division, said Luis Ramos, a lifelong New Yorker who identifies as a Tano, one of the indigenous peoples of the Caribbean. Kids who come to this museum every day have to walk under this statue  think about the message that sends. Its time for it to come down. New York City government offices were closed yesterday in honor of Columbus Day, which celebrates a slaver and murderer who cut off peoples hands if they didnt bring him enough gold. That New York City still shuts down and holds a parade very year for this world-class genocidaire is probably attributable in equal parts to the general cowardice and convictionlessness of New Yorks politicians worried about the Italian-American vote and the inexplicable failure of said demographic to identify a countryman more worthy of celebration than this bloody sociopath. But people keep trying. Around the country, local governments including those of Denver, Phoenix, Spokane, Eugene, and the state of Vermont have all rejected Columbus Day in recent years in favor of Indigenous Peoples Day. In New York, activists say theyve been advised by City Council members that while celebrating an Indigenous Peoples holiday on some other day might be an achievable goal, replacing Columbus Day is a political non-starter. Yesterdays action was intended to challenge that assumption, and to call attention to the way some of the citys institutions and landmarks reinforce the kind of racist ideologies that keep Columbus Day a going concern in the first place. Jessica Lehrman for the Village Voice The protest began with several hundred protesters assembling in the museums Theodore Roosevelt Rotunda, under the looming fossilized skeletons of a Barosaurus and an Allosaurus. The group then toured the second floor of the museum, pausing at intervals to point out the ways in which the displays reflect the racist assumptions that date back to the museums early days. Along with its displays of birds, beasts, plants, minerals and stars, the museum also features exhibits on Asian Peoples, African Peoples, Islam, and Northwest Coast Indians. What sort of division of knowledge, protesters asked, categorizes non-European cultures with primates and meteorites? Where is the hall of Christendom? protesters asked as the moved through the museum, with guards warily looking on. Where is the Hall of European Peoples? Jessica Lehrman for the Village Voice Jessica Lehrman for the Village Voice Jessica Lehrman for the Village Voice After the tour, the protesters filed back out and onto the front steps of the museum, which are dominated by the statue. A team of activists who had been waiting across the street in Central Park approached the statue and attempted, by means of long aluminum poles, to shroud it in a dark parachute. The poles werent quite long enough to cover Roosevelt himself, but after some effort, and despite the half-hearted efforts of some police officers to stop them, the would-be Christos managed to get much of the statue under cover. Jessica Lehrman for the Village Voice The statue is an affront to all who pass it on entering the museum, but especially to African and Native Americans, Kandia Crazy Horse, a musician and activist (and former Village Voice writer) told onlookers. A monument that appears to glorify racial hierarchies should be retired from public view. We demand that City Council members vote to remove this monument to racial conquest. Along with the removal of the statue, protesters also demanded that the museum reconsider the bogus racial classification that assigned colonized peoples to the domain of Nature here and Europeans to the realm of Culture, across the park in the Met, and asked that human remains and sacred objects in the museums collection be returned to indigenous people. They also demanded that the Mayor and City Council rename Columbus Day as Indigenous Peoples Day. The Voice left a message seeking comment from American Museum of Natural History. Well update this post if we hear back. This isnt the first time indigenous activists have called attention to the statue. In 1971, six Native American protesters were arrested for splashing the statue with red paint. If youve seen the statue, a local representative of the National Indian Youth Council told the New York Times afterwards, you know why. <N> Protester at the rotunda of the Museum of Natural History. (Joshel Melgarejo / Gothamist) Four hundred indigenous rights activists occupied the American Museum of Natural History Monday afternoon in protest of Columbus Day and museum exhibitions they consider to be demeaning to indigenous peoples. The protest, which featured a rally on the museum steps, a "de-colonization" tour, and the draping of a large parachute over an equestrian statue of Theodore Roosevelt, was organized by the artist activist group Decolonize This Place in collaboration with a number of community groups, including NYC Stands with Standing Rock. Activists made three major demands of the museum: Remove the Roosevelt Statue, modify exhibits related to indigenous peoples and return various indigenous artifacts to the descendants of those to whom they belonged. They also called on the city to rename Columbus Day as "Indigenous People's Day." The "de-colonization" tour kicked off around 4:30 p.m., with organizers leading roughly 200 protesters through 10 stops in the museum. At each stop, speakers described how a specific exhibit represented or revealed the legacy of colonialism. "Africans are depicted as pre-modern, bearing curious instruments and colorful costumes, instead of present-day people," a speaker explained during a stop at the Hall of African Peoples. "Discrimination against African diasporic peoples is everywhere reinforced by these primitive stereotypes." Luis Ramos, 50, a Taino activist who serves as the director of ceremonies at the Eagle and Condor Community Center, a Native American organization in Astoria, said the museum should return cultural artifacts to indigenous tribes. "Those are sacred objects for us. We honor our ancestors, they should not be in museums," said Ramos, who also goes by the name Sanakori. "They should be reburied or honored by its own people." At the end of the tour, the crowd, which had swelled to 300 people, gathered in the museum rotunda and raised banners while chanting slogans like "Respect, Remove, Rename." The call for the city to rename Columbus Day came as several cities, including Seattle, Denver and Phoenix, have made the name change. After exiting the museum, protesters stood on the steps and called for the museum to tear down the Roosevelt statue, a small group struggled to get the parachute over the 20-foot-tall monument. (Museum security tried to block the protesters from covering the statue, but backed off when the crowd started forcefully chanting.) According to a statement issued by Decolonize This Place, the Roosevelt statue, which features the former president on horseback, with a Native American man and a black man on either side of him, their heads bowed, "has often been cited as the most hated monument in New York City." The statement called the statue a "stark embodiment of the white supremacy that Roosevelt himself espoused and promoted" and an "affront to all who pass it on entering the museum, but especially to African and Native Americans." This isn't the first protest against the statue. In 1971, six members of the Lakota tribes were accused of defacing the statue with paint. In recent weeks, protests on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation over the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, as well as solidarity protests across the country, have placed indigenous rights in the national spotlight. Monday's protest concluded with speeches from representatives of each organization that participated, who called for the U.S. to protect indigenous sovereignty and spoke in support of the Standing Rock protesters. Maggie Gray, 48, who brought her young daughter to the event, said she was impressed with what she saw. "I think being able to meet here at this colonized space of this museum, which not only highlights white supremacy, but is so blatant in its efforts, I think really brings together so much of what's happening politically today, from Black lives Matter to the Trump campaign," she said. The American Museum of Natural History and and the Mayor's Office did not respond to requests for comment on the protest. <N> THIS IS A HEALTH HAZARD SITUATION WHERE THERE IS A REASONABLE PROBABILITY THAT THE USE OF THE PRODUCT CAN CAUSE SERIOUS, ADVERSE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES. Frito-Lay Recalls Jalapeo Flavored Lays Kettle Cooked Potato Chips and Jalapeo Flavored Miss Vickies Kettle Cooked Potato Chips Due to Potential Presence of Salmonella.

the product can cause serious, adverse health consequences. Frito-Lay Recalls Jalapeo Flavored Lays Kettle Cooked Potato Chips and Jalapeo Flavored Miss Vickies Kettle Cooked Potato Chips Due to Potential Presence of Salmonella Frito-Lay today announced it is voluntarily recalling select Jalapeo Flavored Lays Kettle Cooked potato chips and Jalapeo Flavored Miss Vickies Kettle Cooked potato chips due to the potential presence of Salmonella in the seasoning. Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis. This action is the direct result of a suppliers recent recall of a seasoning blend which includes jalapeo powder that could contain Salmonella. Although no Salmonella was found in the seasoning supplied to Frito-Lay, the company has decided to recall these products out of an abundance of caution. No illness related to this matter has been confirmed to date. The products covered by this recall were distributed in retail stores and via foodservice, vending and other channels throughout the U.S. The specific recalled product information is listed below: All sizes of the following two products that have a guaranteed fresh date of JUL 4 or prior printed on the front upper panel of the package: Jalapeo Flavored Lays Kettle Cooked potato chips Jalapeo Flavored Miss Vickies Kettle Cooked potato chips All of the following multipack offerings that have a use by date of JUN 20 or prior printed on the multipack package.

According to a press released, around 9:20 a. m. , Nelly, whose real name is Cornell Haynes, was riding in a Prevost motor coach bus when it was stopped by a trooper. Police say the bus failed to display a U. S Department of Transportation sticker and an International Fuel Tax Association sticker. The trooper said he smelled marijuana emitting from the bus and ... Read more <N> Nelly has reportedly been arrested on felony drug possession charges while in Tennessee. The rapper's bus was pulled over by a trooper on Saturday morning (April 11) for not having two required stickers, the Johnson City Press reports. From there Nelly was charged with felony possession of drugs, simple possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia. The charges came up after the officer smelled marijiuana coming from the bus. After a search was conducted, they found five rocks that tested positive for meth, a small amount of marijiuana as well as drug paraphernalia. Several handguns were also found in the bus. Another man, Brian Jones, was charged with being a felon in possession of a handgun. The 40-year-old rapper (real name Cornell Haynes) was later taken to Putnam County Jail. Reps for the rapper as well as the Putnam County Sheriff's Department had not returned Billboard's requests for comment at press time. Nelly attorney Scott Rosenblum released the following statement on April 11: "Nelly was one of several individuals that was on a tour bus that was stopped and searched while traveling through Tennessee. In fact, there had been 15-20 people that had access to the bus prior to the stop. Allegedly, a small quantity of contraband (MDMA aka Molly or Ecstasy) was discovered during the routine search. We are extremely confident that when the facts come out, Nelly will not be associated with the contraband that was allegedly discovered." <N> Rapper Gets Probation Under Deal With Prosecutors Nelly has scored a no-jail deal in his felony meth case, BOSSIP can reveal. Instead of heading to trial, the rapper agreed to participate in Tennessees pretrial diversion program, where hell be put on probation and could have his record cleared if he stays out of trouble, court officials in Putnam County, Tn. confirmed to BOSSIP. Last spring, the Tennessee Highway Patrol arrested Nelly, real name Cornell Haynes and five other men outside Nashville after a search of his tour bus turned up weed, molly, methamphetamine and several handguns. Nelly denied any involvement with the drugs or the guns, but was charged with felony drug possession, possession of drug paraphernalia and simple possession of marijuana. The case headed to the Grand Jury, and the Putnam County, Tn. District Attorneys office had until today to indict Nelly or toss the case. <N> Florida Georgia Line, Nelly and Chris Lane will reprise the This Is How We Roll Summer Series 2014 with the launch of the Smooth Tour 2017.

This condition results from a shortage of the enzyme lactase, which is normally produced in the small intestine. Levels of lactose intolerance differ from person to person. When cheese is made, 96-98% of the lactose in the milk is removed. As cheese ages, even more lactose disappears. Most people who are lactose intolerant can eat hard, aged cheeses such as Cheddar, Swiss, and Parmesan because theyre naturally low in lactose. As cheese ages, the lactose in the cheese changes into lactic acid, which aids in digestion. Even a non-aged cheese like Mozzarella is less than 1% lactose. Sargento natural cheeses are very low in lactose, and, in fact, many are lactose-free. Be sure to take a look at the nutrition facts panel on the package. If it lists the sugar content as 0g, then the cheese is lactose-free or very low in lactose. Whether you develop symptoms of lactose intolerance often depends on how much cheese and other dairy products you eat, your ability to produce lactase, whether you eat a dairy product with a meal or by itself, and other variables. Generally its beneficial to eat dairy products with meals. If you have questions about lactose intolerance, we suggest you discuss this information with your doctor. <N> CLAIM Several brands of baby wipes available in the U.S. were recalled in 2017 because they pose a risk of serious infection. See Example( s ) EXAMPLES Collected via e-mail, March 2017 It claims that certain brands of baby wipes are being recalled due to pneumonia causing bacteria contamination during January 2017 and mentioned the CDC being involved. But I can't find anything recent on the CDC's or FDA's website and only a few news websites I don't even recognize seem to be carrying the story. Made-up news? On Facebook it states: 10 brands of baby wipes recalled due to pneumonia-causing bacteria contamination. The following brands are included in the nationwide recall: Cuties Diapers.com Femtex Fred's Kidgets Member's Mark Simply Right Sunny Smiles Tender Touch Well Beginnings The baby wipe brands are sold at a variety of retailers including Walgreen's, Family Dollar, Sam's Club and internet retailer Diapers.com. Reports confirm that some of the packages distributed prior to January 21, 2017, contained B. cepacia, prompting the company to halt shipping of all baby wipes produced at the facility. RATING ORIGIN On 11 February 2017, a web site operating under the names Health and DIY Tips or Daily Tips falsely claimed that several brands of baby wipes were recalled in January 2017, and that the products posed a serious risk: Ten brands of baby wipes produced by the Pennsylvania-based Nutek Disposables, Inc., were recalled on January 25, 2017, following complaints of foul odor and discoloration. Upon further testing, the baby wipe and adult washcloth manufacturer discovered that some of their products contained Burkholderia cepacia, a species of antibiotic-resistant bacteria frequently found in soil and water, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Known for its vinegar-like odor, B. cepacia has emerged as a human respiratory pathogen in people with weakened immune systems or chronic lung disease, especially cystic fibrosis patients. Pulmonary infections involving these bacteria are capable of causing accelerated decline in lung functions and can induce cepacia syndrome, a progressive form of pneumonia that can be fatal and untreatable, according to MicrobeWiki. The site specifically said that the wipes were recalled on 25 January 2017, but its content closely matched an October 2014 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) press release about to an obsolete but nearly identical recall: Nutek Disposables, Inc. of McElhattan, PA has initiated a nationwide voluntary product recall at the retail level of all lots of baby wipes that it manufactured under the brand names Cuties, Diapers.com, Femtex, Freds, Kidgets, Members Mark, Simply Right, Sunny Smiles, Tender Touch, and Well Beginnings, because some packages may contain bacteria. These wipes were distributed by Nutek prior to October 21, 2014 to the following retail stores: Walgreens, Sams Club, Family Dollar, Freds, and Diapers.com. After receiving a small number of complaints of odor and discoloration, Nutek conducted microbial testing that showed the presence of a bacteria, called Burkholderia cepacia (B. cepacia), in some of these products. Soon after, on October 3, 2014 the company initiated a voluntary withdrawal of lots that had tested positive for the bacteria, as well as other baby wipes in the surrounding time frame. After some additional lots were tested, as a precautionary measure, Nutek believed it was a prudent decision to withdraw all its baby wipe products. On Twitter, Sams Club (a retailer mentioned prominently in the claim) repeatedly promoted baby wipes in February 2017. No mention of any sort of recall was made in 2017 or 2016 by the account; in 2015, the brand advised a customer that there was no baby wipes recall: @SarahRaphael At this moment there is no active recall for Members Mark baby wipes. Thank you for asking and have a great day!  Sams Club (@SamsClub) July 10, 2015 The Consumer Product Safety Commission did not have any January 2017 wipes recall notices on its site. A wipe warmer was recalled in August 2016, but the notices were clearly unrelated to the claim of a January 2017 baby wipes recall. We contacted Nutek on 1 March 2017, and a company representative described the circulating baby wipes recall rumor as simply a scam. No recall notice was distributed by Nutek about several brands of baby wipes in January 2017, and the wording for the viral rumor appears to have been stolen from an October 2014 Food and Drug Administration press release and updated just enough to ensure clicks and shares on social media. <N> 1917 - 1919 ACTIVATED 1 JUNE 1917 AT PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA, AS THE 3D BATTALLION, 5TH REGIMENT DEPLOYED DURING JUNE-JULY 1917 TO FRANCE PARTICIPATED IN THE FOLLOWING WORLD WAR I OFFENSIVE CAMPAIGNS AISNE AISNE-MARNE ST.

He later took a fatal round to the chest just above his body armor as the Marines were trying to make their way back to base. "We kind of snuck our nose in the south to see what the south was about and we found out real quick that you don't go south unless you have a lot of dudes," said Sgt. Adam Keliipaakaua, who was leading the patrol. Despite the previous occupants, the Marines who pushed out with Ceniceros that fateful afternoon said they didn't realize how dangerous the mud compounds to the south of the base were until the Taliban unleashed a stream of machine-gun fire, pinning down two Marines. Ceniceros, who was killed on Oct. 14, was a member of India Company's 3rd Platoon stationed at Patrol Base Fulod -- a dusty outpost just up the road from the district center that Marines inherited from British forces. The British withdrew in September after four years of fighting that killed more than 100 British soldiers. "You really can't prepare a Marine to lose his good buddy or see another one of his buddies with both his legs blown off," said Capt. Chris Esrey, commander of the battalion's India Company. "The best way to overcome that is to get right back out on a patrol the next day because it doesn't happen every time you go out." Many of the younger Marines also have had to cope for the first time with seeing their best friends die or suffer grievous wounds. Fifteen Marines have been killed and about 50 wounded since the battalion arrived in October -- many by improvised explosive devices or IEDs. "As a new unit coming in, you are at a distinct disadvantage because the Taliban have been fighting here for years, have established fighting positions and have laid the ground with a ton of IEDs," said Lt. Col. Jason Morris, commander of the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment. "You have to evolve quickly because you have no other choice." The Marines patrolling through the green fields and tall mud compounds of Helmand province's Sangin district say they are literally in a race for their lives. They are trying to adjust their tactics to outwit Taliban fighters, who have killed more coalition troops here than in any other Afghan district this year. Irvin Ceniceros, from Clarksville, Arkansas, was one of nine Americans who died in the four days after Marines assumed command of Afghanistan's most dangerous district -- a sign that no amount of training can fully prepare a unit for the battlefield. PATROL BASE FULOD, AfghanistanThe first time U.S. Marines went on patrol from this base in southern Afghanistan, the Taliban were ready. The militants shot and killed a 21-year-old lance corporal just 150 feet from the perimeter. "He died like he lived, a freaking hero caring about other people," said Lt. Joe Patterson, 31, of Owasso, Oklahoma. Patterson is the 3rd Platoon's commander. Keliipaakaua, 26, of Newport News, Virginia, said Ceniceros' tragic death offered critical lessons that can be learned only on the battlefield and might help save others. "You learn from it, you adapt to it and you give it back to the enemy," he said. The Marines now have a better idea of where they will be ambushed around their base and have doubled the size of their patrols to increase the amount of firepower they can direct toward the Taliban. On Thursday, the Marines killed 15 militants in an hourlong firefight, according to NATO. Those who patrol through the main bazaar in the district center now know to look to the skies. They said the Taliban often fly white kites over the local mosque to signal the presence of the Marines. The Taliban like to attack using so-called "murder holes" -- small holes carved into strong mud walls that allow the insurgents to shoot without exposing themselves. The militants also scout the routes the Marines will likely use to evacuate their casualties so they can attack them. As four Marines carried Ceniceros up an alleyway toward the base, they had to dodge a stream of bullets, said Keliipaakaua. To avoid walking into a firefight, the Marines look to see whether kids are around. Their absence could mean an impending attack, but the Taliban also use children as spotters, so the tactic isn't foolproof. "A little kid will run around the corner and run back, and a minute later you are being shot at," said Keliipaakaua. But the threat of an ambush pales in comparison to the biggest danger lurking in Sangin and much of Afghanistan: the scores of IEDs buried in roads, trails, compounds and even canals. Many are largely constructed out of wood or plastic, making them very difficult to detect. Three days after Ceniceros was killed, another member of 3rd Platoon, Cpl. David Noblit, stepped on an IED in a compound located in dense vegetation across the street from Patrol Base Fulod. Noblit survived the explosion but lost both his legs. The battalion has been hit with about 40 IED attacks and has found more than 100 other bombs before they exploded. "You want to vary up your routes to go where the enemy doesn't expect you to travel," said Esrey, 33, of Havelock, North Carolina. "I can walk through water ankle-high, but the bad guys probably know that's where I want to go, so I want to go somewhere the water is chest-high." But the Taliban are always watching and adapting as well. One of the last Marines from the battalion who was killed stepped on an IED buried underwater in a canal. "The tactics keep changing because they're smart and they watch us," said Esrey. "They don't have TV here. We're their TV."  Copyright 2010 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

No, ThanksGO CLOSE Close <N> CLAIM A young boy named Dakota was air lifted to the hospital after having a seizure. RATING WHAT'S TRUE A boy was airlifted to University of Mississippi Medical Center after suffering seizures. WHAT'S FALSE The child's name is Waylon, not Dakota, and the incident occurred back on 3 December 2016. ORIGIN In December 2016, a message requesting that people pray for a young boy named Dakota who was allegedly airlifted to a hospital after having a seizure was widely circulated on Facebook: Although the verbiage of the message varied from post to post, all versions contained three basic elements  The boys name (Dakota), a short account of an emergency situation (he was airlifted to a hospital), and a call to action (please forward this message): Hey can you help get a prayer circle going for Dakota. They had to life flight him. He is having seizures. Forward this everywhere please. we need prayers for this little Boy please forward to all of your friends that prayers thank you This is a friends grandson Many of the messages, such as the one reproduced above, also included some note regarding a familial relation: Other messages were more specific and linked the prayer requests directly to another Facebook user. Those leads, however, also resulted in dead ends. Nearly every message about Dakota lacked credible information about where or when this incident occurred, but we did find a message posted to the prayer board of the Woodland Hills Baptist Church in Longview, Texas, which may have provided some additional details (i.e., the childs full name and location) about the situation: Please pray for Dakota Wells. He is a child from Big Sandy area  he is having continuous seizures and has been air lifted to Dallas. Please pray for his healing  pray for his family and the Medical staff taking care of him. Thanks However, this information was inaccurate. Dakota Wells was not the name of the young boy who was airlifted to the hospital, but rather the name of the Facebook user who originally posted about the sick child. According to Wells, the young boys name is Waylon, her cousin, and he was airlifted to the University of Mississippi Medical Center on 3 December 2016: A GoFundMe Page set up for Waylon Wells provided a little more information about the situation: Waylon was born Dec 3, 2016 son of Evan and Brandy Wells. He was airlifted to UMMC NICU within 3 hours of being born due to heart and lung complications. Prayers are being felt and greatly appreciated but the medical bills, gas and food expenses will be costly while Waylon is in the hospital. Any donation will be greatly appreciated!Help spread the word! Dakota Wells published pictures of Waylon being held by family members on 6 December 2016, three days after he was airlifted to the hospital. In early 2017, an update on his condition was published to the GoFundMe campaigns page along with clarifications pertaining to social media rumors. Waylon was released from the hospital at the time the update was published, anddoing [great]: I just wanted to update everyone on Waylon and clear up any misconceptions about his condition. Waylon does not nor did he ever have any seizures. He has Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, which is a thickening in his right heart muscle. Which he will always have to take medicine for. He will be able to live and function just like a normal child, no one will ever know anything is wrong with him just like a person that has diabetes if they dont tell you, you wouldnt know they had it. Waylon is doing GREAT! He has been home for almost 3 weeks now and is growing and developing as he should be. He sleeps and eats and is just a very content sweet baby boy. He will have routine monthly visits to his cardiologist for at least a year just to keep a check on his heart, all precautionary, he is otherwise a healthy boy! We are more Thankful for your prayers than we could ever express! I am not sure how Evan or myself would have gotten through those two weeks without all of you praying us through everything we were going through! Please continue to remember him in your daily prayers that he continues to grow strong and healthy! Thank yall from the bottom of our hearts Although this prayer request most likely refers to Waylon Wells, the cousin of a Dakota Wells, its also possibly that this viral message refers to an incident in 2014, when a baby named Dakota when airlifted to a hospital in Bismarck. This request has also been conflated with one seeking prayers for a child shot with a nail gun. <N> Over the weekend a one year old little boy that attends my sister and brother in law's church (I attend there as well, but not as active) SOMEHOW.....got ahold of a nail gun, and shot himself in the chest. The nail went through the paracardical sac around his heart and stopped inches before hitting his ventricle. He went through surgery, was on a vent, and was under some serious sedation. Eachday he was showing signs of getting better, even after getting an infection in his blood stream which was found on the nail itself. Everyday I have gotten an update, and everyday I countinue to pray.... TODAY.....Hayden is OFF the vent, breathing on his own, and for the first time since this freak accident his mommy has got to hold him....there was nothing else that needed to be said when I seen this picture..... Hold your babies.....this was one of those freak accident's but those freak accidents can happen to anyone. <N> The philanthropy of the General Mills Foundation serves the world by combining with our company's food expertise, which began more than 150 years ago.

There is the obvious question of whether he would have been elected at all without the help of an enemy nation, and if he hasn't, then we would not have this freak show of a cabinet, with each appointee in charge of something he/she opposes. And the shocking number of executive orders that have cone down, threatening to unravel the US as we know it. But while this deserves no legal remedy, it nevertheless is true: I doubt very much if voters had a second chance, they would not vote the same way they did. Clinton was the most flawed candidate the DNC could have picked. However, most Trump supporters NOW know that he lied when he promised to protect Medicare and Social Security. They now know he lied when he said he had a beautiful health care plan that would cover everyone for cheaper. They now see thst he didn't actually clarify that ACA and Obamacare are the sane thing, or That Medicaid expansion and pre-existing clause protections would go away (these surprised more than 1/3 of voters). They now know that he would have his own server and carry his own Android phone (this doesn't seem to bother them, but...) They now see that due to the electoral college, their "protest vote" would actually result in the actual election if this person. And they now see that he has dealt with EVERY issue on the planet EXCEPT for Roe v Wade. The buyer's remorse is heavy with this one. Check out the Trumpgrets or his historically poor approval records. Even without the Russia revelation, I think America wants a redo. While he will always have the support of those who would cheer if he "shot a man in the street," I think enough people would vote differently on his broken promises alone. Impeachment isn't strong enough. The entire staff has been tainted with this. The Secret Service had already begun refusing to show him sensitive information. The GOP will have lost all credibility, and there is reason to believe our nation will no longer be a Democracy in four years. If this were a just world, the election would be considered null and void, and voters would correct the problem. But we don't live in a just world. <N> A longshot legal petition to nullify the 2016 federal elections based on the Constitution's "Guarantee Clause" just moved forward at the Supreme Court this week, after last week the Trump administration declined to reply. Our Supreme Court set the case for Conference on Friday, March 17th to put the petition in front of all of the Justices. (see below) According to a career prosecutor interviewed for this story, four of the eight justices must then vote that Blumstein vs. U.S. meets their high standard to go to a full hearing. Additionally, the three Massachusetts women who petitioned the court have asked for the appointment of a Special Master, which is a special officer to weigh the evidence and make findings to the Court. There has never before been a case about the Constitution's Guarantee Clause (which obliges the federal government to protect states from foreign invaders) like this decided in front of the Supreme Court. Three extraordinary citizens from Massachusetts filed this court action, seeking to nullify the election late last year. They cited the actions of Austria and Ukraine who held revotes after unfairly held elections as legal precedents. Diane Blumstein, Nancy Goodman, and Donna Soodalter-Toman argue in the case, that Russia cyber invaded America and that our Intelligence Community's reports in October and January, along with the FBI's public statements prove that our Executive Branch concluded a foreign invader influenced the 2016 elections. The lower court called the case of Blumstein vs. U.S. a "novel constitutional question," but said that question of if the United States had suffered a foreign cyber invasion was a question best decided by the "political branches" of government like Congress or the Executive Branch. Since then, the Obama Administration released a lengthy declassified report to the public - on the same day that the lower court issued the opinion - in which seventeen executive branch agencies concluded that Russia used cyber military units from their GRU to invade American cyberspace as part of Putin's plan to aid Donald Trump and attack Hillary Clinton. Lawyers call these Cases of First Impression, and this one presents a real series of never before answered questions to the Supreme Court: Can the Supreme Court consider intelligence reports and statements of the former President as conclusory that an invasion has taken place? (and if so, will they review the top-secret report?) Does a private party have the right to enforcement of the Constitution's Guarantee Clause? Do the judges as a non-political matter have the right to nullify a federal election after multiple states election systems were intruded upon? Is the cyber intrusion by Russian armed forces into the DNC's Headquarters on federal land in Washington D.C. sufficient to conclude that an invasion has taken place? It's a fascinating case and presents a series of logically sound reasons why a jurist might take action. The women from Massachusetts also argue that Russian influence into Congressional elections has caused an unresolvable conflict of interest in investigating the matter. It is well documented that Russian cyber invasion struck the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which the New York Times reported, and we even interviewed one of the targeted Democratic candidates. However, Blumstein vs. U.S. is also a terrifying long shot. The petition has a 1% chance of even being heard by the court, let alone of being decided favorably for the three brave citizens from Massachusetts who've brought this ultimate longshot legal challenge to fruition. We'll keep you posted when the Supreme Court issues a decision about if the Court elects to take the case, and if so when oral arguments are scheduled. But don't hold your breath, the court must find on first a reason to believe that there's a clear entitlement to relief by the three Massachusetts women to interfere with a federal election Copyright:  All Rights Reserved Download as PDF, TXT or read online from Scribd <N> Every petition that is docketed at the U.S. Supreme Court, and remains on the docket, will eventually be distributed for a conference, usually held on a Friday. The date of the conference depends upon whether or not the Court is in session, in recess or on vacation. (There were 39 conferences during the 2011 Term.) Does this mean the Court will discuss each petition distributed during their conference? Absolutely not! Although this is a very closely guarded secret, I would estimate that, at best, only 20-25% of the petitions distributed for a given conference are actually discussed during that conference and few, if any, of those discussed, are granted. Those which arent discussed, become automatically denied. The process is quite simple. Each week of the year, the clerks office distributes petitions, due for distribution to the justices chambers, for a conference, which is generally held, if the Court is in session, 2 weeks later. Each chamber receives a copy of each petition. However, in 1972, the Court instituted a pooling system whereby each justice, who participates in the pool, is only responsible for his or her proportionate number of petitions distributed. Currently, eight justices participate in the pool, so his or her chambers are only responsible for 1/8th of the petitions and the 9th justice (currently Justice Alito) is responsible for reviewing all petitions distributed. For those justices participating in the pool, the petitions are read by one of the four law clerks typically found in each of the justices chambers. Each of them writes a memo as to each petition he or she read that summarizes the petition with a recommendation as to whether or not the petition is cert-worthy. These pool memos are then distributed to the participating justices. Prior to the conference, the Chief Justice circulates a discuss list containing any petitions he deems worthy of further discussion. Each justice can add to the list any petition he or she deems worthy. Very few, if any, petitions on the discuss list are granted. The remaining petitions, as I have stated, are automatically denied. Twenty years ago, the Court was hearing about 125 petitions per-Term, and there were about 2,500 paid petitions filed each year. Today, the Court elects to hear about 78-80 petitions, and the paid docket hovers at the 1,600 mark. The Court claims there are much fewer cert-worthy petitions. Others claim that the power of the clerks has increased and they are too timid to recommend that cert be granted. Some clerks even boast about never having recommended one petition for certiorari during their year-long tenure. It is hard to blame the clerks, though, since the decline in plenary review has been going on long before the pool system was instituted. In any event, distributed for conference is a somewhat misleading phrase. Tagged: Appellate Practice, Oral Argument, History, Supreme Court of the United States <N> The group Americans Take Action made the news in early January 2017 with their announcement that, having been unsuccessful in their efforts to urge Republican electors to reject Donald Trump and vote for a more qualified president, they were seeking to invalidate the results of the Electoral College vote because more than 50 electors were ineligible: More than 50 Electoral College members who voted for Donald Trump were ineligible to serve as presidential electors because they did not live in the congressional districts they represented or held elective office in states legally barring dual officeholders. That stunning finding is among the conclusions of an extensive 1,000-plus page legal briefing prepared by a bipartisan nationwide legal team for members of Congress who are being urged to object to certifying the 2016 Electoral College results. Trumps ascension to the presidency is completely illegitimate, said Ryan Clayton of Americans Take Action, who is promoting the effort. Its not just Russians hacking our democracy. Its not just voter suppression at unprecedented levels. It is also [that] there are Republicans illegally casting ballots in the Electoral College, and in a sufficient number that the results of the Electoral College proceedings are illegitimate as well. The lengthy documentation offered by Americans Take Action argues (among other things) that some electors lived outside the congressional districts they represented (in violation of state requirements, that some electors also held state or local offices (in violation of state requirements that they not hold multiple offices), and that some states did not provide two distinct lists of votes (one for President and one for Vice President) as required by the U.S. Constitution. Critics contend that none of these arguments is particularly persuasive, holding that the Constitution grants state legislatures the power to appoint electors in any manner of their choosing, that serving as an elector does not constitute holding an office (and that, in any case, electors have long been drawn from the ranks of elected officials without objection), and that the formality of submitting dual lists is one that has long been (in the words of Shakespeare) more honored in the breach than the observance. Nonetheless, Clayton hopes that when the Congress meets in joint session to count the electoral votes on 6 January 2017, sufficient numbers of Republicans in Congress will not vote to ratify the Electoral College results, thus depriving Trump of the 270 Electoral College votes he needs to win the presidency. But as the referenced legal briefing notes, only two objections have ever been properly raised in Congress under the provisions of the Electoral Count Act of 1887, and both were overruled. The chances that Republicans in the House and Senate are going to uphold dozens of different objections (based on premises they have no time to investigate) and vote against certifying the election of a Republican candidate as President of the United States are, to most observers, very slim indeed. <N> CLAIM A law professor is working to take Donald Trump's election win away by appealing to electoral college voters. See Example( s ) EXAMPLES Is it true that a Larry Lessig is trying to steal the Presidential election with something called the Electors Trust? RATING ORIGIN On 13 December 2016, Harvard law professor Larry Lessig announced that he was aware of at least twenty Republican Electors who are seriously considering voting their conscience  and not voting for Donald J. Trump. Lessig launched an organization called Electors Trust, where he offers members of the Electoral College  who are scheduled to cast their votes on 19 December 2016  legal counsel and support for potentially rejecting the votes in their state and refusing to cast their ballots for Trump, thereby blocking him from being elected (a failsafe that was written into the Constitution, but has never been used to overturn a presidency). In a press statement, Lessig said: Obviously, whether an elector ultimately votes his or her conscience will depend in part upon whether there are enough doing the same. We now believe there are more than half the number needed to change the result seriously considering making that vote. Trump won enough votes in key states to achieve the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election. His victory was not without contention; shortly thereafter, Green Party candidate Jill Stein filed petitions for vote recounts in swing states Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. Now, Lessig believes he can convince 37 electors to cast faithless votes and strip Trump of the victory. Whether its true that Lessig has 20 electors on board is impossible to verify unless they make themselves public. So far, only one Republican elector has publicly stated he will not vote for Trump  Chris Suprun of Texas. The effort seems unlikely to be successful. While Trumps rival, Hillary Clinton, won the popular vote by roughly 2.8 million votes as of 15 December 2016, Clinton has not contested the election results. Current President Barack Obama has also made it clear there is no question that Trump will succeed him. But Lessig called the ability of electors to take the election away from Trump a constitutional emergency brake: Never in our history has the argument for electors exercising their independent judgment been as overwhelmingly strongbecause of the concerns about foreign involvement in our election, because of Mr. Trumps refusal to comply with constitutional limitations on foreign assets, and because of the overwhelming popular vote margin by his opponent. Some states require electors by law to vote the way their state voted (although the penalties to vote against their state are relatively low). According to an NPR analysis, that leaves 155 who would still be able to change their votes  however unlikely the prospect seems. <N> Payments Update The Fresh Milk Products Price-fixing Class Action payout amounts have been finalized. We received more claims than anticipated, which lowered the expected payout amounts on a fixed settlement fund. Individuals will receive $6.79, and entities will be receiving $190.13. The appeals deadline has now passed, but unfortunately, there were 3 appeals submitted by objectors to the settlement, which means payments cannot start until those appeals are resolved. It is now in the hands of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Regrettably, the wheels of justice dont always move at the pace we want, and objectors to a settlement can hold up payments for all class members. We are working hard to resolve the appeals so we can get payments in the hands of all claimants. We do apologize for the delays and truly appreciate your patience with this process.

This cow-killing program exploited both the animals and the consumers, and resulted in the early deaths of half a million cows, attorney Cheryl Leahy told The Huffington Post in an email. Leahy is general counsel for Compassion Over Killing, an animal protection group that spearheaded the suit. Alvis Upitis via Getty Images The settlement means that anyone who purchased dairy products in one of several states between 2003 to the present could be entitled to a cash payout. (Details are here.) Class action firm Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP filed the suit in 2011 on behalf of dairy consumers, against dairy lobbying group National Milk Producers Federation and industry cooperatives Dairy Farmers of America, Land O Lakes, DairyLea Cooperative and Agrimark. The suit states that Cooperatives Working Together, a trade group led by the NMPF, oversaw a herd retirement program between 2003 and 2010. That retirement program consisted of dairy cooperatives buying out entire herds of cattle  primarily from small farms  and sending them for early slaughter. (Spent dairy cows are typically slaughtered for cheap ground beef, Leahy said, though she couldnt speak to the fate of each cow in this program.) This limited the supply of raw milk, thus driving up prices for products like yogurt, cream and cottage cheese, according to the suit. Moxie Productions via Getty Images An animal protection group says the settlement sends the message that the dairy industry is not above the law. Cooperatives Working Together actually had information about its so-called dairy herd retirement, program on its own website, along with economic analysis  showing how much the industry profited from the program, Leahy said. We took that information and analyzed the applicable law. At least some of that data is still online. A 2009 analysis by Scott Brown of the University of Missouri-Columbia found that between 2004 and 2008, herd retirement added an average $0.59 per 100 pounds of milk. Brown did not immediately reply to a request for comment from HuffPost. But CWT claims that the program was not about prices. The groups website until recently included a frequently asked questions section about the program, which it characterizes as a voluntary self-help farmer-funded program that allowed dairy farmers who wanted to stop farming, to exit farming altogether. Jim Mulhern, NMPF president and CEO, called the settlement the most sensible and responsible course of action in a statement, while noting that the defendants were not found guilty of violating any laws. It is important to note that the court has found no antitrust violation and CWT makes no admission of wrongdoing in this settlement, he said. The group declined to comment beyond the prepared statement. That said, Leahy is still counting the decision as a victory. This settlement sends a message to the dairy industry that they cannot harm people and animals out of simple greed without any accountability, she said. They are not above the law. This article has been updated to reflect that CWT has removed its frequently asked questions page from its website. Correction: This article has been updated to reflect that consumers in certain states who purchased dairy products from 2003 to the present  not just until 2011  may be entitled to a payout. <N>  Class action settlement: Have you purchased milk, dairy products in WI since 2003? You could be owed money! MILWAUKEE  Have you purchased milk in Wisconsin from 2003 to the present? Were willing to bet the answer is YES  and if so, you could be owed money! Customers who purchased milk or other dairy products including cream, half & half, yogurt, cottage cheese, cream cheese, or sour cream from 2003 to the present in Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, West Virginia, or Wisconsin may receive between $45 and $70 (with entities receiving between $1,260 and $1,960) as part of a class action lawsuit. Claims must be submitted online or by mail by January 31st. Claims may be submitted online HERE or by mail to: Fresh Milk Products Antitrust Litigation PO Box 43430 Providence, RI 02940-3430 The class action lawsuit resulted in a $52 million settlement with National Milk Producers Federation, aka Cooperatives Working Together (CWT), Dairy Farmers of America, Inc., Land OLakes, Inc., Dairylea Cooperative Inc., and Agri-Mark, Inc. This antitrust lawsuit alleges a nationwide conspiracy by CWT and its members to limit the production of raw farm milk by prematurely slaughtering cows, in order to illegally increase the price of milk and other fresh milk products. Defendants deny any wrongdoing or liability for the claims alleged. <N> A controversial program that slaughtered cows after buying out dairy farms as a means to reduce milk production is ending in a multimillion dollar payout to consumers. Wisconsin is called the dairy state for good reason. Most people in Wisconsin are milk consumers, Patrick Carey explained as he shopped for milk at Miller and Sons in Verona. Carey, a father of six said he raised his kids on it and spent thousands on milk while they were growing up. Now, like many, he is eligible to get money back. Anybody that bought some dairy bought some milk from 2003 to 2010 can claim some damages, Bob Cropp, a UW-Madison economist, said. It's all because of a class action lawsuit which was recently settled out of court for $52 million. It accused the Herd Retirement Program run by Cooperatives Working Together of conspiring to kill cows to keep prices high. While Cropp, an expert witness for the milk producers, admits the program was used to reduce milk supply and stabilize prices he said the reason was far less cruel. It was a nice way for them to exit out of the dairy business if they decided to do that, my take is the impact on the actual milk price for the consumer, pretty minimal, Cropp said. In total nearly 3,000 farms were bought out resulting in the slaughter of more than 500,000 cows,over seven years. It's unclear how much money consumers will get back. Cropp estimates between $10 to $70 dollars. More than 15 states are involved to be eligible you must apply at boughtmilk.com by the end of the month. Youre also eligible if you bought other dairy products like yogurt, sour cream, or even cottage cheese. <N> If you're worried about rumors concerning a child kidnapped in Harrisburg over Christmas weekend, we're happy to say we can put those worries to rest.

If you're worried about rumors concerning a child kidnapped in Harrisburg over Christmas weekend, we're happy to say we can put those worries to rest. The child in the photo is 7-year-old Ariel Revello. He is NOT from Harrisburg and, most importantly, he is NOT missing. While he was at the center of an AMBER Alert from Connecticut in March 2016, he is now safe and sound. If you see this boy's photo circulating on social media, kindly debunk this rumor to your friends. We know your heart is in the right place and you meant well by sharing the post. Here is where you can find a list of children who are actually missing and still need to be brought home: <N> TRUMBULL  Police have obtained a warrant for a 43-year-old man they say kidnapped his son this weekend, although they still do not know where the man is. A 7-year-old Trumbull boy was found safe in New York Saturday and authorities were still searching for his father, Rodolfo Revello, who they said took the boy earlier in the day after forcing his way into the mother's home and assaulting her. The incident triggered an Amber Alert that was canceled at about 6:30 p.m. after police found the boy, identified as Ariel Revello, in Queens, N.Y. Trumbull police said in an email late Saturday that Revello called Trumbull police shortly after 5 p.m. and said he was "leaving his son, Ariel, with a relative." New York police then went to the relative's home and retrieved the boy who was "safe and unharmed," the Trumbull police email said. Police said the boy was reunited with his mother Saturday night. Police said Revello forced his way into the home on Unity Road in Trumbull at about 4:30 a.m. Saturday, assaulted his estranged wife there and fled with their young son, setting off the alert, police said. Throughout the day, police searched for a white 2015 Ford van that police said Revello was driving when he took the boy and went to New York. In a news conference Saturday afternoon, police said that Revello has a criminal record and that Ariel's mother has an active restraining order against the father. Police said Ariel's mother was assaulted in her bedroom by Revello, who had forced his way into the house. At one point, Revello got a knife from the kitchen, but he was disarmed by his 17-year-old stepson before he returned to the bedroom, police said. The mother escaped by jumping out her bedroom window and hiding in the yard, police said. She was treated at a hospital for non-life threatening injuries, and was later released, police said. Revello took several thousand dollars worth of cash and jewelry from the mother's room before waking Ariel and leaving the house with him in the van, police said. Revello's criminal arrest record includes convictions in Connecticut for third-degree assault, disorderly conduct, violating conditions of his release and driving under the influence twice, according to the state of Connecticut judicial branch's online criminal records database. The database said Revello was arrested by Stamford police in January and charged with second-degree breach of peace. Details of the incident were not available on the database. He is scheduled to appear in Superior Court in Stamford on Wednesday for a pre-trial hearing on the pending breach-of-peace case. The warrant includes charges second-degree kidnapping, second-degree larceny, criminal violation of a restraining order, second-degree strangulation, second-degree assault, second-degree criminal mischief and disorderly conduct. Police said that "multiple law enforcement agencies are currently attempting to locate Revello." <N> Trumbull cops: Suspected kidnapper caught in N.Y. window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-4', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 4', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); Photo: Contributed Photo / Contributed Photo Image 1 of / 4 Caption Close Image 1 of 4 Rodolfo Revello, 43, is being sought in connection with the abduction of her 7-year-old son, Ariel Revello on Saturday, March 12, 2015.

U.S. Marshals have arrested the man suspected of kidnapping his own 7-year-old son from the boys mothers Trumbull home, police said. Investigators found 43-year-old Rodolfo Revello  who has already been to prison for his role supplying cocaine to the Latin Kings gang  in the Bronx, according to a statement from police Lt. Leonard Scinto, a spokesman for the police department, and was arrested without incident. Revello is currently being charged with a federal violation of probation and arrangements are currently being made to serve Revello with the arrest warrant obtained by the Trumbull Police Department following the violent domestic on March 12 which resulted in an amber alert, said Scinto. In the early hours of March 12, Revello forced his way into the home of his estranged wife and assaulted her in her bedroom, police said, at one point grabbing a knife from the kitchen before his 17-year-old stepson was able to disarm him. The woman escaped through a bedroom window and was able to hide out in the backyard. She ended up going to a local hospital but was released the same day, and the stepson was uninjured. But, police said, Revello did seize his 7-year-old son and flee in a white Ford Transit van. State police, the New York State Police Department, the New York Police Department and the Federal Bureay of Investigation joined the manhunt throughout the day on March 12. Police said Revello kept an address in Greenwich and that they suspected he may have crossed into New York. Later the same day police announced that the boy had been located in Queens, N.Y. Revello himself had called Trumbull police around 5 p.m. March 12 to tell them he had left the boy with a relative, and NYPD officers found the child safe and uninjured. Trumbull police obtained a warrant for Revellos arrest on March 14. According to federal court documents, Revello supplied cocaine to the Latin Kings gang members, who then sold the drug to customers in the Stamford area. For several months, police made multiple controlled purchases of cocaine from those supplied by Revello. On May 10, 2011, police arrested Revello when he was buying 50 grams of cocaine from a co-defendant for about $1,700, court documents stated. Revello was already on federal probation related to the drug charges. State court records also list convictions for assault, disorderly conduct and driving under the influence and one pending case for breach of peace. Federal court records indicate that Revello was sentenced to 60 months in prison in 2012, and he was released in September 2014. When police do charge Revello, he will face counts of second-degree kidnapping, second-degree larceny, violating a restraining order, second-degree strangulation, second-degree assault, second-degree threatening, second-degree criminal mischief and disorderly conduct. Scinto said Revellos bond was set at $500,000. Editors note: The amount of Revellos bond has been corrected. Trumbull police had given out a wrong amount in an earlier version of this story. <N> Warrant issued for dad charged with kidnapping his 7 year-old son window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-3', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 3', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); Photo: Trumbull Police Department Photo Image 1 of / 3 Caption Close Image 1 of 3 Rodolfo Revello, 43, is being sought in connection with the abduction of her 7-year-old son, Ariel Revello on Saturday, March 12, 2015.

Police in Bridgeport responded to a tip Monday that the white van had been found, parked and vacant, on a city street. During the home invasion Saturday, Revello at one point retrieved a knife from the kitchen, but was disarmed by his 17-year-old stepson before he was able to return to the bedroom, a police spokesman said.. The woman was able to jump out a bedroom window and hide in the yard. Revello allegedly rounded up several thousand dollars worth of cash and jewelry from the house before grabbing Ariel Revello, 7, and making a run for it. Police said Revellos home address is in Greenwich, and he may have crossed over the state line . The woman was treated for minor injuries at a local hospital and released by early afternoon Saturday. The 17-year-old stepson was not injured, said Trumbull police Lt. Leonard Scinto. Police Chief Michael Lombardo said the search was ongoing and town police were coordinating efforts with the Connecticut State Police, FBI, New York State Police and the New York City Police Department. Police said Revellos home address is in Greenwich. Police stressed that anyone with information on his whereabouts should call the authorities immediately. Scinto confirmed that a state judge had issued a restraining order against Revello on the estranged wifes behalf. He was not able to detail conditions of the order, but said Revello had visitation rights with the two boys. According to federal court documents, the father supplied cocaine to the Latin Kings gang members, who then sold the drug to customers in the Stamford area. Revello is on federal probation related to drug charges. State court records also list convictions for assault, disorderly conduct and driving under the influence and one pending case for breach of peace. Federal court records indicate that Revello was sentenced to 60 months in prison in 2012, and he was released in September 2014. Revello will be charged with second-degree kidnapping, strangulation, assault and larceny, along with criminal violation of a restraining order, threatening, criminal mischief and disorderly conduct, Scinto said.

While all children born on U.S. soil are automatically granted full citizenship rights, undocumented families allege that Texas has recently raised the bar for the types of documentation it accepts from immigrants who seek birth certificates for their U.S.-born children. A group of undocumented parents filed a lawsuit against the state in May, arguing that Texas officials should continue recognizing ID cards issued by the Mexican consulate as an acceptable form of documentation. In his ruling Friday, U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman was sympathetic toward the state in questioning the reliability of the consulate-issued IDs, known as matricula consular cards. While the Court is very troubled at the prospect of Texas-born children, and their parents, being denied issuance of a birth certificate  a birth certificate is a vital and important document. As such, Texas has a clear interest in protecting access to that document, Pitman wrote. RELATED: Explaining Marco Rubios confusing immigration answers Lawyers representing the more than two dozen undocumented families had asked for the court to intervene immediately to compel the state to issue birth certificates while the full case winds through the legal system. In denying their request for a preliminary injunction, Pitman found that the parents did not meet the bar to warrant emergency relief. But Pitman also noted that the lack of a birth certificate presented grave difficulties for the parents of Texas-born kids in obtaining social benefits or even having them baptized. Republican presidential candidates have made birthright citizenship a major campaign issue this election cycle, with some 2016 hopefuls calling to change the way Americans interpret the U.S. Constitution in order to deny citizenship rights to the children of undocumented immigrants. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, hailed the ruling as an important first step in ensuring the integrity of birth certificates and personal identity information. Before issuing any official documents, its important for the state to have a way to accurately verify people are who they say they are through reliable identification mechanisms, he said in a statement. <N> Since Donald Trump announced his intention to run for president, there have been several issues in connection with immigration policy that have become the subject of debate. One of the most heated debates has surrounded the issue of whether illegal immigrants who give birth to children in the United States should be able to obtain citizenship and whether their children born on United States soil can in fact obtain birth certificates. Within the state of Texas, many counties simply will not grant birth certificates for children born in the United States to parents who are undocumented. Mexico has threatened that this recent failure to issue birth certificates could greatly threaten the relationship with Mexico. Given Mexicos proximity to Texas, this is a major issue that needs to be addressed. Mexico involved itself in this immigration debate due to two of their nationals who were undocumented that filed a brief to sue Texas for being denied birth certificates for their children. What further enraged Mexican authorities was that the parents even provided proper documentation accepted by the Mexican Consulate as a proper legal form of documentation. That being said, the state of Texas refutes these allegations claiming that consulate-issued identification is not necessarily reliable. <N> Judge Says Texas Can Continue Denying Birth Certificates To Immigrants' Kids Texas can  for now  continue to deny issuing birth certificates to the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants, a federal judge decided on Friday. If you remember, a group of undocumented immigrants sued the state because it refused to issue birth certificates saying certain types of identification cards issued by foreign governments could not be used. The parents of the American children argued that Vital Statistics offices were refusing to accept a matrcula, an ID card issued by Mexican consulates across the country, and a foreign passport without a U.S. visa as valid forms of IDs. Those identifications, the parents argued, are the most commonly available to illegal immigrants living in the U.S. U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman in Austin was considering whether to force the state to accept those types of IDs while the case moved through the courts. The judge said that without a doubt, Texas-born children of undocumented immigrants are being hurt by the Texas decision. Their constitutional right to travel and free exercise of religion by way of baptism are being curbed. In his opinion, Pitman said he was "very troubled" by the prospect of Texas-born children being denied a birth certificate. Still, he said, a birth certificate is an important document and Texas has an interest in "protecting access to that document." The state has a right, he said, to make sure that that the types of IDs they accept are valid and reliable and other governmental agencies, like the FBI, have expressed concern about the reliability of the the matrcula. Pitman concludes: "In summary, although the Plaintiffs have provided evidence which raises grave concerns regarding the treatment of citizen children born to immigrant parents, this case requires additional determinations which can be made only upon development and presentation of an evidentiary record which thoroughly explores the facts and circumstances of the issues raised in this case." So, for now, Texas can continue to deny birth certificates to U.S.-born children of immigrants, pending a decision in this case. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement that this ruling was an "important first step in ensuring the integrity of birth certificates and personal identity information." He went on: "Before issuing any official documents, it's important for the state to have a way to accurately verify people are who they say they are through reliable identification mechanisms. We will continue defending DSHS's policy on safeguarding Texans' most sensitive information and vital documents." <N> Parents said they could not obtain the required documents. They had not been able to baptize their children, enroll them in school or sign them up for public health programs so they could be vaccinated. With no legal document proving the babies were their children, parents feared that if they were deported, their families might be separated or that the children might not able to return to the only country where they were citizens. In court, Texas did not deny its policy, but said that the immigrant families did not need birth certificates to gain access to state programs. But the judge hearing the case, Robert L. Pitman of the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, had signaled he was skeptical of that argument. In a ruling in October, Judge Pitman said Texas claim that a birth certificate was not a vital document simply begs credulity. Under the settlement, Texas confirmed that Mexican immigrants will be able to present a Mexican voter identification card. Under a recent change by Mexico, its citizens can now obtain those cards from consulates in the United States. Parents from three Central American countries  El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras  will be able to present documents certified by their consulates. Texas has also set up a review process for parents whose applications were rejected, as well as training for more than 450 county officials who issue birth certificates. The judge agreed to a monitoring period of nine months to make sure Texas was complying. Juana Gomez, 34, a Mexican immigrant without legal status, said she was relieved that her two daughters, born in South Texas hospitals, would get their certificates. Ms. Gomez, who has been living in this country for 20 years, said she had to delay their baptisms, and Border Patrol agents had demanded to see their birth certificates at checkpoints well inside the United States. <N> Claim: Woman gains revenge after being charged $250 by Neiman Marcus for a cookie recipe. FALSE Examples: [Collected on the Internet, 1996] My daughter & I had just finished a salad at Neiman-Marcus Cafe in Dallas & decided to have a small dessert. Because our family are such cookie lovers, we decided to try the Neiman-Marcus Cookie. It was so excellent that I asked if they would give me the recipe and they said with a small frown, Im afraid not. Well, I said, would you let me buy the recipe? With a cute smile, she said, Yes. I asked how much, and she responded, Two fifty. I said with approval, just add it to my tab. Thirty days later, I received my VISA statement from Neiman-Marcus and it was $285.00. I looked again and I remembered I had only spent $9.95 for two salads and about $20.00 for a scarf. As I glanced at the bottom of the statement, it said, Cookie Recipe  $250.00. Boy, was I upset!! I called Neimans Accounting Dept. and told them the waitress said it was two fifty, and I did not realize she meant $250.00 for a cookie recipe. I asked them to take back the recipe and reduce my bill and they said they were sorry, but because all the recipes were this expensive so not just everyone could duplicate any of our bakery recipes.the bill would stand. I waited, thinking of how I could get even or even try and get any of my money back. I just said, Okay, you folks got my $250.00 and now Im going to have $250.00 worth of fun. I told her that I was going to see to it that every cookie lover will have a $250.00 cookie recipe from Neiman-Marcus for nothing. She replied, I wish you wouldnt do this. I said, Im sorry but this is the only way I feel I could get even, and I will. So, here it is, and please pass it to someone else or run a few copies. I paid for it; now you can have it for free.

[Collected via e-mail, June 2009] A little background: Woolworths (South Africa), if you dont know already, is a very expensive clothing and supermarket outlet (they sell a typical R50 T-shirt for R150). My daughter and I had just finished lunch at a Woolies Cafe in Hyde Park, Johannesburg. Because both of us are such biscuit lovers, we decided to try the Woolies Cookie. It was so excellent that I asked if they would give me the recipe. The waitress said with a small frown, Im afraid not, but you can buy the recipe. I asked how much, and she responded; Only two fifty  its a great deal I agreed to that, and told her to add it to my bill. Thirty days later, I got my Visa statement, and the Woolworths charge was R485. I looked at it again, and I remembered I had only spent R49.95 for two sandwiches and about R120 for a scarf. At the bottom of the statement, it said, Cookie Recipe  R250.00. That was outrageous! I called Woolworths Accounting Department and told them the waitress had said it was two fifty, which clearly does not mean two hundred and fifty Rands by any reasonable interpretation of the phrase. Woolworths refused to budge. They would not refund my money because according to them; What the waitress told you is not our problem. You have already seen the recipe. We absolutely will not refund your money. I explained to the Accounting Department lady the criminal statutes which govern fraud in the state of Gauteng. I threatened to report them to the Better Business Bureau and The Attorney Generals office. I was basically told: Do what you want. Dont bother thinking of how you can get even, and dont bother trying to get any of your money back I said, OK, youve got my R250, and now Im going to have R250 worth of fun. I told her that I was going to see to it that every cookie lover in the world with an e-mail account gets a R250 cookie recipe from Neiman-Marcus for free. She replied, I wish you wouldnt do that. I said, Well, perhaps you should have thought of that before you RIPPED ME OFF! and slammed down the phone. So here it is! Please pass it on to everyone you can possibly think of. I paid R250 for this, and I dont want Woolworths to EVER make another cent from this recipe!

PLEASE KEEP THE RECIPE AND SEND IT TO EVERY PERSON YOU KNOW WHO HAS AN E-MAIL ADDRESS! This is not a joke-its a true story. Origins: What we have here is a golden oldie of an urban legend, the ultimate strike a blow for the little guy tale, and in that aspect lies its appeal: by forwarding it on, we can be armchair heroes. Though its present incarnation casts the Neiman Marcus chain of department stores as the bad guy, this legend has been around for at least 70 years or so, and its been told of various companies (and various confections) during its long history. Heres a fine example from a 1948 cookbook, Massachusetts Cooking Rules, Old and New, which lists not only the recipe for $25 Fudge Cake but also gives the following explanation for the name: This friend had to pay $25 upon the receipt of the recipe from the chef of one of the railroads. She had asked for the recipe while eating on a train. The chef gladly sent it to her, together with a bill for $25, which her attorney said she had to pay. She then gave the recipe to all her friends, hoping they would get some pleasure from it. Sound disturbingly familiar? The 1960s saw this tale mutate into a villainization of New Yorks famed Waldorf-Astoria hotel over a dessert known as Red Velvet Cake. A woman whod dined at the hotel later wrote to ask for the recipe. The recipe arrived  along with a bill for $350, a bill her lawyer assured her she had to pay. Her way of getting even was  you guessed it  to distribute the recipe far and wide. ($350 was a shocking figure for those times. Just to give an idea of the relative worth of things back then, the grocery budget at my house was $50 a week for a family of four. Faced with a $35 dentist bill, my mother would for the next two weeks stand over me as I brushed my teeth at bedtime, making sure I wasnt half doing the job and thus sentencing the family to the poor house.) By the late 1970s, this legend had shifted to Mrs. Fields and chocolate chip cookies. Indeed, this version proved so fiendishly popular that in 1987 the following notice signed by Debbi Fields was displayed in her stores: Mrs. Fields recipe has never been sold. There is a rumor circulating that the Mrs. Fields Cookie recipe was sold to a woman at a cost of $250. A chocolate-chip cookie recipe was attached to the story. I would like to tell all my customers that this story is not true, this is not my recipe and I have not sold the recipe to anyone. Mrs. Fields recipe is a delicious trade secret. You rarely hear this tale told of Mrs. Fields these days  the 1990s saw it shift yet again, this time to point a finger at Neiman-Marcus. One possible reason for this shift could have been a double misremembering of names as the legend was briefly told of the department store Marshall Fields: Mrs. Fields to Marshall Fields (similar name) and Marshall Fields to Neiman Marcus (similar-sounding name plus both are department stores). Two decades after it spiked in popularity through forwarded e-mails, the Neiman-Marcus cookie story evolved and spread on a new medium: Facebook. In early January 2016, tens of thousands of Facebook users re-shared the well-worn tale anew; while much changed between its appearance in 1996 and re-appearance in 2016, the two-fifty aspect of the tale remained intact. Precisely why the decades-old tale was received so readily by a social media audience was unclear, but the legends reinvigorated popularity might have been partly generational. As the latest in a long line of victims, Neiman Marcus has fielded numerous inquiries about the following tale (which Ive excerpted from the rather lengthy canonical version): My daughter & I had just finished a salad at Neiman-Marcus Cafe in Dallas & decided to have a small dessert. Because our family are such cookie lovers, we decided to try the Neiman-Marcus Cookie. It was so excellent that I asked if they would give me the recipe and they said with a small frown, Im afraid not. Well, I said, would you let me buy the recipe? With a cute smile, she said, Yes. I asked how much, and she responded, Two fifty. I said with approval, just add it to my tab. Thirty days later, I received my VISA statement from Neiman-Marcus and it was $285.00. I looked again and I remembered I had only spent $9.95 for two salads and about $20.00 for a scarf. As I glanced at the bottom of the statement, it said, Cookie Recipe  $250.00. Boy, was I upset!! I called Neimans Accounting Dept. and told them the waitress said it was two fifty, and I did not realize she meant $250.00 for a cookie recipe. (Neiman Marcus refuses to strike down the bill; then comes the usual exhortation from the writer to pass this along to as many as possible.) Especially in the particular case of Neiman Marcus, the legend is even more improbable than usual in that: There was no such thing as a Neiman-Marcus cookie when this tale began circulating about that company. They developed a chocolate chip cookie in response to the rumor. There is no Neiman Marcus Cafe at any of the chains three Dallas-area stores. Instead, the restaurants are named Zodiac, Zodiac at North Park, and The Woods. Neiman Marcus does not sell recipes from its restaurants. The department store gives them away for free to anyone who asks and openly published their chocolate chip cookie recipe on their web site). As to why this legend has taken on a life of its own despite persistent and detailed debunkings, its a classic David and Goliath story. It is, after all, the little guy smacking the big, heartless corporation a swift one right across the nose, something many people have often longed to do. This bit of netlore invites  nay, demands  participation. Painless participation too.

Numerous visits to specialists didnt give a cause of her cerebral atrophy for many years. In late 2014, doctors told the family she would likely not survive another year. With the prospect of Addies last Christmas, her grandparents thought it would be nice for her to receive a lifetime of Christmas cards. That year, the community and people from all around the world sent her more than 300,000 Christmas cards, letters and even gifts. Cards and gifts werent the only things the community did to help Addie celebrate Christmas. Fountain Green held its first Christmas parade, organized especially for Addie. Nearly a year after receiving the terminal diagnosis, Addie was as happy as ever, her family said. She was able to celebrate her seventh birthday last September. On her birthday, doctors in Boston told the family Addie may have a genetic mitochondrial disease, but more tests were needed to better understand her condition. But there was no cure for the disease. Thank you for your continued prayers as we say farewell to our princess, a family statement posted to the Little Addie Facebook page reads. Email: [email protected] <N> Each day, the Make-A-Wish Foundation and its chapters receive hundreds of inquiries about chain letters claiming to be associated with the Foundation and featuring sick children. However, we do not participate in these kinds of wishes. Some names associated with these wishes are: Amy Bruce, Jeff DeLeon, Rhyan Desquetado, LaNisha Jackson, Nikisha Johnson, Jessie Anderson, Kayla Wightman, Craig Shergold, Craig Sheldon, Craig Sheppard, Craig Shelton, Craig Shelford, Anthony Hebrank, Chad Briody and Bryan Warner. If you receive a chain letter claiming ties to the Foundation, please: Inform the sender that the Foundation does not participate in chain letter wishes. Refer the sender and all recipients to this page. Do not forward the chain letter. Refer senders to ways they can help the Foundation, such as referring a child, making a donation or volunteering at a local chapter. Examples of false Make-A-Wish chain letters currently circulating include: Various versions of an e-mail claiming a sick child will receive money from the Foundation each time the e-mail is forwarded. Sick children trying to get in the Guinness Book of World Records by receiving the most greeting cards or business cards. Sick children requesting Christmas cards from around the country. Only one of these requests is based in fact: In 1989, a then 9-year-old boy named Craig Shergold wanted to be recorded in the "Guinness Book of World Records" for receiving the most greeting cards. His wish was fulfilled in 1990 by another wish-granting organization not associated with the Make-A-Wish Foundation. He received more than 16 million cards. Craig is now a healthy adult, and he has requested an end to the mail. Mail that is received is forwarded to a recycling center. The time and expense required to respond to these inquiries distracts the Foundation from its efforts on behalf of children with life-threatening medical conditions, and more importantly, can divulge information that is potentially harmful to a child and his or her family. <N> 900 numbers, some 800 numbers, and some international numbers are used to provide information and entertainment services such as sports scores, weather forecasts, stock market updates, psychic readings, etc. The service providers, not the phone companies that bill on their behalf, set the charges. Fraudulent service providers trick people into calling their services without any agreement to use them or disclosure about how much they cost. While most 800 number calls are free, charges can be made for pay-per-call services provided through 800 numbers if the consumer agrees beforehand. Fraudulent service providers try to claim that there was an agreement even though there wasn't. While calls to most foreign countries require dialing 011, a country code, a city code, and then the number, calls to Canada and some parts of the Caribbean don't. They can be reached by dialing the same number of digits as in the U.S. So you may not recognize a number as foreign - until you get the bill. When you dial a foreign number, your local phone company connects you to your long-distance company, which connects you to the phone company in the country you are calling. That company connects you to the number you dialed. Part of what you pay for the call goes to the foreign phone company - and the scammer profits by arranging to share the revenue with the company. Be wary of faxes, pages, e-mails, and voice messages to call numbers that you don't recognize. Don't dial unless you know who and where you're calling. If you are not sure where a long-distance number is, call 00 and ask the operator or use the Area Code Look Up Service provided free on the Telecommunications Research & Action Center website. Educate your employees about pay-per-call scams and implement firm policies about calling pay-per-call services and other uses of your business phone lines. The person responsible for paying your phone bills should check them carefully. If you question charges for 900 or 800 number pay-per-call services, contact the company at the number that appears on that portion of the bill. Also, notify the telephone company that sent you the bill. Deduct the disputed charges while they are being investigated and pay the rest of the bill on time. If you were duped into calling a foreign phone number, notify your long-distance company. While you are generally responsible for ong-distance charges, your long-distance company may agree to make an adjustment, at least on a one-time basis. You can arrange with your local phone company to block anyone from dialing 900 numbers on your phone. But blocking 800 number and international dialing may not be practical. <N> Pager Scams Scenario: Your pager shows a number you dont recognize. There may be a message indicating a family emergency or an urgent legal matter. When you return the call you get a recorded message that has nothing to do with your family or a legal problem. Scam: Later you find charges on your phone bill for an international call or a service you never authorized. Don't return the call to a number on your pager that you don't recognize. It may be an attempt to lure you to call a foreign phone number, a 900 number or an 800 number pay-per-call service, resulting in high charges on your phone bill. 900 numbers, some 800 numbers, and some international numbers are used to provide information and entertainment services such as sports scores, weather forecasts, stock market updates, psychic readings, etc. The service providers, not the phone companies, set the charges.

Educate everyone in your business who carries pagers about pager and other phone scams. You can arrange with your local phone company to block 900 numbers from being dialed from your phone.

Military mail postage rates are the same as domestic rates. A 37-cent First-Class stamp will also deliver a letter to a U.S. military service member located halfway around the world. The Postal Service processes APO (Air/Army Post Office) and FPO (Fleet Post Office) mail similar to domestic mail, with all military addresses, regardless of where they may be located around the globe, being assigned a ZIP Code, referred to as an APO or FPO number. The Postal Service places APO/FPO mail on international commercial passenger service and international cargo service aircraft from various cities. When the plane lands overseas, the mail is tendered to the Military. The mail is then handled by Military Postal Service representative and transported to the military post office for distribution to the service members unit for delivery to the addressee. A. No. The free mailing privilege only applies to military service personnel and designated civilians in specially designated areas with limited postal support. In other words, it is only free for those deployed personnel in designated overseas locations identified by The Department of Defense(DoD). This program is not for their loved ones, family, or friends back home. A. Regular domestic postage rates apply for mailing overseas. There are no discounts for mailing from the U.S. to overseas APO and FPO addresses. A. The time varies, but typically military mail letters are delivered between seven and 10 days depending on country of destination. Priority parcels will take 10 to 15 days. Parcel Post takes about 24 days, according to MPSA (Military Postal Service Agency) officials. Transit times will vary depending on operational conditions and the unit of the addressee. Those in established bases should continue to receive regular service, while those in forward areas or engaged in operations may experience longer arrival times due to logistical constraints. During Desert Storm we equated this with the military postal system having to forward mail to a population rivaling that of the city of Richmond, VA that was moving through an area the size of the U.S. east of the Mississippi river. A. Only if you have the name and address. Programs that allowed people to send mail to servicemembers unknown to them were discontinued following the terrorist attacks of 2001. Mail addressed as Any Service Member, Any Soldier, Sailor, etc. will not be accepted. If this mail is deposited into a collection box it will be returned to sender. Items without return addresses are opened in our Mail Recovery Center Network to determine the senders address. If it is impossible to determine the senders address, we donate care items to local charities. A. The Department of Defense (DoD) recommends programs that support military service members families at home. If you would still like to donate to deployed servicemembers, the DoD recommends visiting the Defend America Home Page for a listing of support organizations. A. The DoD has become aware of organizations and individuals who solicit donations or money for care packages and use unit addresses and/or a list of servicemember names to send the packages to deployed forces. These programs are usually supported by well-intentioned and patriotic people who are simply unaware of the new risks facing deployed military forces. Some individuals and groups have even publicized the names and addresses of servicemembers, ships or units on Web sites, without realizing that personal information may be used inappropriately. Visit the Defend America Home Page and click on Support our Troops to find DoD recommended ways to show your support. A. The DoD has requested that those who send mail use the servicemembers full name (with or without grade, rank, or rating), or a specific title (e.g., Commanding Officer, Supply Officer, etc.). Also required is the unit designation and APO/FPO (Air/Army Post Office or Fleet Post Office) address with the nine-digit ZIP Code (if one is assigned) and a return address. For packages, mailers are asked to print on one side only with the recipients address in the lower right portion. Do not include the country or the base camps city, as it might be routed through the host countrys mail system. A. Each country has customs regulations that apply to all incoming mail. These may include prohibitions on certain kinds of food or entertainment products. While there are specific restrictions for each five-digit military post office ZIP Code (APO/FPO), generally speaking, it is prohibited to mail the following to this region: obscene articles (prints, paintings, cards, films, videotapes, etc.) any matter depicting nude or seminude persons, pornographic or sexual items, or non-authorized political materials bulk quantities of religious materials contrary to the Islamic faith. Items for the personal use of the addressee are permissible pork or pork by-products For specific restrictions to an APO/FPO address, please visit the Overseas Military Mail page. You can also call 1-800-ASK-USPS or consult your local post office. The Military Postal Service Agencys toll free number 1-800-810-6098, is available Monday-Friday, 7:30 am  4:30 p.m. A. The intent of this customs prohibition was the host country's concern about distributing these materials to its citizens. Mailing a Bible or other individual religious item as long as it is solely for the personal use of the service member should not be an issue. A. At times, some military units may have additional restrictions imposed by the unit commanders, such as those on size and weight, to ensure logistics support can handle the mail along with other necessities. The maximum length of a package in any category is 72 inches. In addition, Military ZIP Code restrictions may change as military units move to different locations. All applicable restrictions for about 3,000 overseas military ZIP Codes are entered into the U.S. Postal Service computer terminals and published in the Postal Bulletin. A. Its a good idea to keep the following in mind to ensure that packages are delivered promptly. Extreme Temperatures: Desert temperatures typically exceed 100 degrees. The Box: Select a box strong enough to protect the contents and large enough to accommodate cushioning. If reusing a box, cover all previous labels and markings with a heavy black marker or adhesive labels. Cushioning: Cushioning the contents with newspaper is a novel way to send news from home. Styrofoam and bubble wrap are also good choices. Close and shake the box. If it rattles, add additional cushioning to keep items from shifting. Batteries: Occasionally a battery powered item such as a radio or electric razor will turn itself on during shipment. Be sure to remove and wrap the batteries separately. Sealing: Tape the opening of the box and reinforce all seams with 2 wide tape. Use clear or brown packaging tape, reinforced packing tape or paper tape. Do not use cord, string or twine as it causes the package to get caught and possibly damaged in sorting equipment. Include a card describing the contents: Occasionally improperly wrapped packages fall apart during shipment. Including a card inside the package that lists the senders and recipients addresses along with a description of the contents helps in collecting items that have fallen open during processing. A. Letter mail is not being opened unless it appears unusually bulky, military officials said, in which case it may be examined to see if it contains contraband, such as drugs. Parcel mail is being examined on a spot-check basis to determine conformity with host country customs regulations and for terrorist-type mailings. <N> Every year there is a Facebook Post that goes viral asking citizens to send Holiday Cards for service members, veterans and families receiving care to Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Walter Reed Army Medical Center, on Georgia Ave closed more than 5 years ago.

Also, if you see the Facebook Post, please help us by responding to correct it. This year you can also assist a service member, veteran and their families by providing cards they can send home to their loved ones this holiday season. The deadline for all cards including Hanukkah, Christmas and Kwanzaa is Wednesday, November 30, 2016.
